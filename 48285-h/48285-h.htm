<p>The Government condemns in the highest degree the conduct of any of our
citizens who may personally engage in committing hostilities at sea against
any of the nations parties to the present war, and will exert all the means
with which the laws and Constitution have armed them to discover such as
offend herein and bring them to condign punishment.… The practice of
commissioning, equipping, and manning vessels in our ports to cruise on any
of the belligerent parties is equally and entirely disapproved; and the Government
will take effectual measures to prevent a repetition of it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Jefferson</span>,
<i>Letter to Mr. Hammond, May 15, 1793</i>: Writings, Vol. III. p. 559.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>One spot remains which oceans cannot wash out. The slavery of the African
race, which the North Americans had inherited from the ancient monarchy,
was adopted and fondly cherished by the new Republic.… The
logic of the Constitution declared that all men were free: the pride and
avarice of the slave-owners, disowning the image of the Creator and the
brotherhood of nature, degraded men of a dark color, and even all the
descendants of their sons and daughters, to a level with oxen and horses.
But as oxen and horses never combine, and have no sense of wronged independence,
oxen and horses are better treated than the men and women
of African blood.… But neither the philosophical dogma of the authors
of the Constitution, nor the strict pedantry of law, can stifle the cry of outraged
humanity, nor still the current of human sympathy, nor arrest forever
the decrees of Eternal Justice.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord John Russell</span>, <i>Life and Times of
Charles James Fox</i>, Vol. I. pp. 364, 365.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>To this condition the Constitution of this Confederacy reduces the whole
African race; and while declaring these to be its principles, the founders
claim the privilege of being admitted into the society of the nations of the
earth,&mdash;principles worthy only of being conceived and promulgated by the
inmates of the infernal regions, and a fit constitution for a confederacy in Pandemonium.
<i>Now, as soon as the nature of this Constitution is truly explained
and understood, is it possible that the nations of the earth can admit such a Confederacy
into their society? Can any nation calling itself civilized associate,
with any sense of self-respect, with a nation avowing and practising such principles?</i>
Will not every civilized nation, when the nature of this Confederacy
is understood, come to the side of the United States, and refuse all association
with them, as, in truth, they are, <i>hostes humani generis</i>? For the African is
as much entitled to be protected in the rights of humanity as any other portion
of the human race. <i>As to Great Britain, her course is, in the nature of
things, already fixed and immutable. She must sooner or later join the United
States in this war, or be disgraced throughout all future time</i>; for the principle
of that civilization which this Confederacy repudiates was by her&mdash;to her
great glory, and with unparalleled sacrifices&mdash;introduced into the code of
Civilization, and she will prove herself recreant, if she fails to maintain it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Josiah
Quincy</span>, <i>Address before the Union Club of Boston, February 27, 1863</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>If British merchants look with eagerness to the event of the struggle in
South America, no doubt they do so with the hope of deriving advantage
from that event. But on what is such hope founded? On the diffusion of
beggary, on the maintenance of ignorance, on the confirmation of slavery, on
the establishment of tyranny in America? No; these are the expectations
of Ferdinand. The British merchant builds his hopes of trade and profit on
the progress of civilization and good government, on the successful assertion
of Freedom,&mdash;of Freedom, that parent of talent, that parent of heroism, that
parent of every virtue. The fate of South America can only be accessory to
commerce as it becomes accessory to the dignity and the happiness of the
race of man.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Sir James Mackintosh</span>, <i>Speech in Parliament, on the Foreign
Enlistment Bill, June 10, 1819</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>When a power comparable only to Thugs, buccaneers, and cannibals tries
to thrust its hideous head among nations, and claims the protection and privileges
of International Law,&mdash;a power which rose against the freest rule on
earth for the avowed motive of propagating the worst form of Slavery ever
known, having no legitimate complaint, or, if it had, certainly trying no
constitutional means of redress, but plunging at once into arms, and that
when the arsenals had been emptied and the fortresses seized by the treason
of office-holders,&mdash;I hold it to be an offence against law, order, and public
morality for a statesman whose words carry weight to speak at all of such a
power without declaring abhorrence of it.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Professor Francis W. Newman</span>,
<i>Letter to Mr. Gladstone, December 1, 1862</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>I blame men who are eager to admit into the Family of Nations a state
which offers itself to us, based upon a principle, I will undertake to say,
more odious and more blasphemous than was ever heretofore dreamed of in
Christian or Pagan, in civilized or in savage times. The leaders of this revolt
propose this monstrous thing: that over a territory forty times as large
as England the blight and curse of Slavery shall be forever perpetuated.&mdash;<span class="smcap">John
Bright</span>, <i>Speech at Birmingham, December 18, 1862</i>.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>We are already culpable for a part of this bloody war; for, better informed
or less indifferent, less selfish or more adroit, above all, more wise, more
sincerely the friends of what is right, we could, from London and Paris, have
thrown into the midst of the combatants this declaration, which would have
rendered the conflict ephemeral: “Never will either England or France,
Christian nations, liberal nations, recognize the existence of a people seeking
to found Liberty and Independence on Slavery!” The misfortune of the
times, in obscuring our judgment, in dulling our passion for the beautiful
ideas of Freedom, has, then, already made us participants, in some respect,
in the rebellion of the people of the South, and, in order to mask what was
gross and low in our voluntary error, we set up vague reasons of commercial
policy and general policy at which our fathers would have blushed.…
The truth is, that the revolt of the South is the most impudent and most
odious insult that has ever been offered to the ideas of modern Civilization.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Journal
des Économistes</span>, Avril, 1864, Tom. XLII. p. 88.</p>

<p>The following speech<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> was delivered at the invitation of the New
York Young Men’s Republican Union, at Cooper Institute, on the 10th
of September, 1863. The announcement that Mr. Sumner had consented
to address the citizens of New York on a subject so momentous attracted
an audience numbering not less than three thousand persons, among
whom were most of the acknowledged representatives of the intelligence,
wealth, and influence of the metropolis. Long before the hour appointed
for the delivery of the speech, the entrance-doors were besieged
by an impatient and anxious crowd, who, as soon as the gates were
opened, filled the seats, aisles, lobbies, and platform of the vast hall,
leaving at least an equal number to return home, unable to gain an entrance
to the building.</p>

<p>Of the following named gentlemen, who were invited to occupy seats
upon the platform, a majority were present, while in the auditorium
were hundreds of equally prominent citizens, who preferred to retain
seats near the ladies whom they had escorted to the meeting.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

critical as it is at this moment. In what agony of mortal struggle this nation
has passed the last two years we all know. A rebellion of unparalleled extent,
of indescribable enormity, without any justifiable cause, without even
a decent pretext, stimulated by the bad passions which a barbarous institution
had originated, and encouraged by expected and promised aid from
false men among ourselves, has filled the land with desolation and mourning.
During this struggle it has been our misfortune to encounter the evil
disposition of the two nations of Western Europe with which we are most
closely associated by ties of blood, common history, and mutual commerce.
Perhaps I ought to have said the evil disposition of the governments, rather
than of the nations; for in France the people have no voice, and we know
only the imperial will and policy, while in England the masses have no
powers, the House of Commons being elected by a fraction of the people,
and the aristocratic classes being against us from dislike to the freedom of
our institutions, and the mercantile classes from the most sordid motives
of private gain. To what extent this evil disposition has been carried, what
causes have stimulated it, in what acts it has manifested itself, and what
consequences may be expected to follow from it in future, will be explained
by the distinguished orator who is to address you this evening. His position
as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has given
him an acquaintance with the subject equal, if not superior, to that of any
other person in the country. He needs no introduction from me. His name
is an introduction and a passport in any free community between the Atlantic
and the Pacific seas; therefore, without saying more, I will give way for
<span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>, of Massachusetts.”</p>

</div>

<p>Amid the most marked demonstrations of satisfaction, expressed frequently
by long-continued applause and hearty cheers, Mr. Sumner
proceeded in the delivery of his discourse. The meeting adjourned
about an hour before midnight.</p>

<p>Three New York newspapers and two in Boston printed the entire
speech on the day following its delivery.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;From the beginning of the
war in which we are now engaged, the public interest
has alternated anxiously between the current of
events at home and the more distant current abroad.
Foreign Relations have been hardly less absorbing than
Domestic Relations. At times the latter seem to wait
upon the former, and a packet from Europe is like a
messenger from the seat of war. Rumors of foreign
intervention are constant, now in the form of mediation,
and then in the form of recognition; and more than
once the country has been summoned to confront the
menace of England, and of France, too, in open combination
with Rebel Slavemongers battling in the name of
Slavery to build an infamous power on the destruction
of this Republic.</p>

<p>It is well for us to turn aside from battle and siege
at home, from the blazing lines of Vicksburg, Gettysburg,
and Charleston, to glance for a moment at the
perils from abroad: of course I mean from England and
France; for these are the only foreign powers thus far
moved to intermeddle on the side of Slavery. The subject
to which I invite attention may want the attraction
of waving standards or victorious marches; but, more
than any conflict of arms, it concerns the civilization of
the age. If foreign powers can justly interfere against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
human freedom, this Republic will not be the only sufferer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is always a natural order in unfolding a subject,
and I shall try to pursue it on this occasion, under
the following heads.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The perils to our country from foreign powers,
especially foreshadowed in the unexpected and persistent
conduct of England and France since the outbreak
of the war.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The nature of foreign intervention by mediation,
with the principles applicable thereto, illustrated
by historic instances, showing especially how England,
by conspicuous, wide-spread, and most determined intervention
to promote the extinction of African Slavery, <i>is
irrevocably committed against any act or policy that can
encourage this criminal pretension</i>.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The nature of foreign intervention by recognition,
with the principles applicable thereto, illustrated
by historic instances, showing that by the practice of
nations, and especially by the declared sentiments of
British statesmen, <i>there can be no foreign recognition
of an insurgent power, where the contest for independence
is still pending</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly.</i> The moral impossibility of foreign recognition,
even if the pretended power be <i>de facto</i> independent,
where it is composed of Rebel Slavemongers
seeking to found a <i>new</i> power with Slavery for its
declared “corner-stone.” Pardon the truthful plainness
of the terms I employ. I am to speak not merely of
Slaveholders, but of people to whom Slavery is a passion
and a business, therefore Slavemongers,&mdash;now in
rebellion for the sake of Slavery, therefore Rebel Slavemongers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Fifthly.</i> The absurdity and wrong of conceding ocean
belligerence to a pretended power, which, in the first
place, is without a Prize Court, so that it cannot be an
ocean belligerent <i>in fact</i>,&mdash;and, in the second place, even
if ocean belligerent <i>in fact</i>, is of such an odious character
that its recognition is a moral impossibility.</p>

<p>From this review, touching upon the present and the
past, leaning upon history and upon law, enlightened
always by principles which are an unerring guide, our
conclusion will be easy.</p>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>The perils to our country, foreshadowed in the action
of foreign powers since the outbreak of the war, first
invite attention.</p>

<p>There is something in the tendencies of nations which
must not be neglected. Like individuals, nations influence
each other; like the heavenly bodies, they are disturbed
by each other in their appointed orbits. Apparent
even in peace, this becomes more so in the convulsions
of war, whether from the withdrawal of customary forces
or from their increased momentum. It is the nature of
war to enlarge as it continues. Beginning between two
nations, it gradually widens its circle, ingulfing other
nations in its fiery maelström. Such is human history.
Nor is it different, if the war be for independence. Foreign
powers may for a while keep out of the conflict;
but examples of history show how difficult this has
been.</p>

<p>There was liberty-loving Holland, which, under that
illustrious character, William of Orange, predecessor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
exemplar of our Washington, rose against the dominion
of Spain, upheld by the bigotry of Philip the Second,
and the barbarity of his representative, Alva; but the
conflict, though at first limited to the two parties, was
not slow to engage Queen Elizabeth, who lent to this
war of independence the name of her favorite Leicester
and the undying heroism of Sidney, while Spain retorted
by the Armada. The United Provinces of Holland,
in their struggle for independence, were the prototype
of the United States of America, which I need not
remind you drew into their contest the arms of France,
Spain, and Holland. In the rising of the Spanish colonies
there was less interposition of other nations, doubtless
from the distant and outlying position they occupied,
although not beyond the ambitious reach of the
Holy Alliance, whose purposes were so far thwarted by
Mr. Canning, backed by the declaration of President
Monroe, known as the Monroe doctrine, that the British
statesman felt authorized to boast that he had called
a new world into existence to redress the balance of the
old. Then came the struggle of Greece, which, after
painful years darkened by massacre, but relieved by exalted
self-sacrifice, shining with names, like Byron and
Bozzaris, that cannot die, challenged the powerful interposition
of England, France, and Russia. The independence
of Greece was hardly acknowledged, when Belgium,
renouncing the rule of the Netherlands, claimed
hers also, and here again the great powers of Europe
were drawn into the contest. Then came the effort of
Hungary, inspired by Kossuth, which, when about to
prevail, aroused the armies of Russia. There was also
the contemporaneous effort of the Roman Republic,
under Mazzini, which, almost successful, evoked the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
bayonets of France. We have only recently witnessed
the resurrection of Italy, inspired by Garibaldi, and directed
by Cavour; but it was not accomplished, until
Louis Napoleon, with well-trained legions, bore the imperial
eagles into battle.</p>

<p>Such are famous instances, being so many warnings.
Ponder them, and you will see the tendency, the temptation,
the irresistible fascination, or the commanding
exigency under which foreign nations have been led
to participate in conflicts for independence. I do not
dwell on the character of these interventions, although
mostly in the interest of Human Freedom. It is only
as examples to put us on our guard that I adduce them.
The footprints all lead one way.</p>

<p>Even our war is not without its warning. If thus far
in its progress other nations have failed to intervene,
they have not succeeded in keeping entirely aloof. The
foreign trumpet has not sounded yet, but more than
once the cry has come that we should soon hear it,
while incidents too often occur, exhibiting abnormal
watchfulness of our affairs and uncontrollable passion
or purpose to intermeddle in them, with signs of unfriendly
feeling. This is applicable especially, if not
exclusively, to England and France.</p>

<p>And at the outset, as I am about to speak frankly, I
quote the words of an eminent English statesman and
orator, who felt it his duty to criticize Spain. From his
place in the House of Commons, whence his words flew
over Europe, Mr. Canning, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If, in what I have now further to say, I should bear
hard upon the Spanish Government, I beg that it may be
observed, that, unjustifiable as I shall show their conduct
to have been&mdash;contrary to the Law of Nations, contrary to
the law of good neighborhood, contrary, I might say, to the
laws of God and man&mdash;with respect to Portugal, still I do
not mean to preclude a <i>locus pœnitentiæ</i>, a possibility of redress
and reparation.”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Fellow-citizens, you shall decide, on hearing the story,
if we also have not complaints; but I, too, hope that
all will end well.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(1.) One act of the British Cabinet stands foremost
as an omen of peril,&mdash;foremost in time, foremost also
in the magnitude of its consequences. Though plausible
in form, it is none the less injurious or unjustifiable. I
refer to that inconsiderate Proclamation, in the name of
the Queen, as early as 13th May, 1861, which, after
raising Rebel Slavemongers to equality with the National
Government, solemnly declares “neutrality” between
the two coëqual parties: as if the recognition
of equality was not an insult to the National Government,
and the declaration of neutrality was not a moral
absurdity, offensive to reason and all those precedents
which make the glory of the British name. Neutrality
is equality; neutrality is equity. It is both. But is
there just equality between these two parties? Can
neutrality between such parties, especially at the very
outset, be regarded as equity? Even if the Proclamation
could be otherwise than improper at any time in such a
rebellion, it was worse than a blunder at that early date.
The apparent relations between the two powers were
more than friendly. Only a few months had passed
since the youthful heir to the British throne was welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
everywhere, except in Richmond, as in the land
of kinsmen. And yet, at once, after tidings of the
Rebel assault on Fort Sumter, before the National
Government had begun to put forth its strength, and
even without waiting for the arrival of our newly appointed
minister, who was known to be at Liverpool,
on his way to London, the Proclamation was suddenly
launched. I doubt if any well-informed person, who
reads Mr. Dallas’s despatch of 2d May, 1861, recounting
a conversation with the British Secretary, will undertake
to vindicate it in point of time. “I informed
him,” the minister reports, “that Mr. Adams had apprised
me of his intention to be on his way hither in
the steamship Niagara, which left Boston on the 1st
May, and that he would probably arrive in less than two
weeks, by the 12th or 15th instant. His Lordship acquiesced
in the expediency of disregarding mere rumor,
<i>and waiting the full knowledge to be brought by my successor</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
And yet the blow was struck without waiting.
The alacrity of this concession was unhappy, for it bore
an air of defiance, or at least of heartlessness, towards
an ally of kindred blood engaged in the maintenance
of its traditional power against an infamous pretension.
More unhappy still was it that the good genius of England
did not save this historic nation, linked with so
many triumphs of Freedom, from a fatal step, which,
under the guise of “neutrality,” was a betrayal of Civilization
itself.</p>

<p>It is difficult to exaggerate the consequences of this
precipitate, unfriendly, and immoral concession, which
has been, and still is, an overflowing fountain of mischief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
and bloodshed,&mdash;“<i>hoc fonte derivata clades</i>,”&mdash;<i>first</i>, in
what it vouchsafes to Rebel Slavemongers on sea and
in British ports, and, <i>secondly</i>, in the removal of impediments
from British subjects ready to make money out
of Slavery,&mdash;all of which has been declared by undoubted
British authority. Lord Chelmsford, of professional
renown as Sir Frederick Thesiger, now an ex-Chancellor,
used these words recently in the House
of Lords: “If the Southern Confederacy had not been
recognized by us as <i>a belligerent power</i>, he agreed with
his noble and learned friend [Lord <span class="smcap">Brougham</span>], that
any Englishman aiding them by fitting out a privateer
against the Federal Government <i>would be guilty of piracy</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
But this is changed by the Queen’s Proclamation.
For Rebel Slavery there is recognition; for
the British subject opportunity of trade. For Rebel
Slavery there is fellowship and equality; for the British
subject a new customer, to whom he may lawfully
sell Armstrong guns, and other warlike munitions
of choicest British workmanship, and, as Lord Palmerston
tells us, even ships of war, to be used in behalf of
Slavery.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> What was unlawful is suddenly made lawful,
while the ban is taken from an odious felony. It seems
superfluous to add, that such concession, thus potent in
reach, must have been a direct encouragement and overture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to the Rebellion. Slavery itself was exalted, when
barbarous pretenders, battling to found a new power in
its hateful name, without so much as a single port on
the ocean where a prize could be carried for condemnation,
were yet, <i>in face of this essential deficiency</i>, swiftly
acknowledged as <i>ocean</i> belligerents, while, as consequence,
their pirate ships, cruising for plunder in behalf
of Slavery, were acknowledged as national ships, entitled
to equal immunities with the national ships of the
United States. This simple statement is enough. It
is vain to say that the concession was a “necessity.”
There may have been strong temptation to it, constituting,
perhaps, imagined necessity, as with many there
is strong temptation to Slavery itself. But such concession
to Rebels fighting for Slavery can be vindicated
only as Slavery is vindicated. As well declare “neutrality”
between Right and Wrong, between Good and
Evil, with concession to Evil of belligerent rights, and
then set up the apology of “necessity.”</p>

<p>If he is an enemy who does what pleases an enemy,
according to the rule borrowed by Grotius from the
Christian lawyer of the age of Justinian,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> then did England
become the enemy of the National Union, for this
most fruitful concession rejoiced beyond measure the
Rebel enemy.</p>

<p>(2.) An act so essentially unfriendly in character,
and also in the alacrity with which it was done, too
clearly indicated an unfriendly sentiment, easily stimulated
to menace of war. And this menace was not wanting,
when, soon afterwards, the two Rebel emissaries on
board the Trent were seized by a patriotic, brave commander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
whose highest fault was, that, in the absence
of instructions from his own Government, he followed
British precedents only too closely. This accident&mdash;for
such it was, and nothing else&mdash;assumed at once overshadowing
proportions. With indefensible exaggeration,
it was changed by the British nation, backed by the
British Government, into a <i>casus belli</i>,&mdash;as if an unauthorized
incident, obviously involving no question of
self-defence, could justify war between two civilized
nations. And yet, in the face of positive declaration
from the United States, communicated by our minister
at London, that it was an accident, the British Government
<i>made preparations to take part with Rebel Slavery</i>,
and fitly began such an ignoble proceeding by keeping
back from the British people the official despatch of 30th
November, 1861, where our Government, after announcing
that Captain Wilkes had acted “without any instructions,”
expresses a “trust that the British Government
would consider the subject in a friendly temper,”
and promises “the best disposition” on our part.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> It is
painful to recall this exhibition. But it belongs to history,
and we cannot forget the lesson it teaches.</p>

<p>(3.) This tendency to espouse the side of Slavery
appears in small things as well as great, becoming more
marked in proportion to the inconsistency involved.
Thus, where two British subjects, “suspected” of participation
in the Rebellion, were detained in a military
prison without the benefit of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, the British
minister at Washington was directed to complain of
their detention <i>as inconsistent with the Constitution of
the United States</i>, of which this intermeddling power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
assumed to be “expounder”; and the case was accordingly
presented on this ground.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> But the British Cabinet,
with instinct to mix in our war, if only by diplomatic
notes, seemed to have forgotten the British Constitution,
under which, in 1848, with consent of all the
party leaders, Brougham and Lansdowne, Peel and Disraeli,
<i>Habeas Corpus</i> was suspended in Ireland, and the
Government authorized to apprehend and detain “such
persons as they shall suspect.” The bill sanctioning
this exercise of power went through all its stages in
the House of Commons on one day, and the next day
went through all its stages in the House of Lords without
a dissenting vote. It is hard to believe that Lord
Russell, who complains of our detention of “suspected”
persons as inconsistent with the Constitution of the
United States, was the minister who introduced this
bill, and on that occasion used these words: “I believe
in my conscience that this measure is calculated to prevent
insurrection, to preserve internal peace, <i>to preserve
the unity of this empire</i>, and to secure the throne of these
realms and the free institutions of this country.”<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>(4.) The complaint about <i>Habeas Corpus</i> was hardly
answered, when another was solemnly presented, founded
on the legitimate effort to complete the blockade of
Charleston, by sinking at the mouth of its harbor ships
laden with stone, usually known as “the stone blockade.”
Did anybody find fault with the Russians for
sinking their men-of-war in the harbor of Sebastopol?
Nor is the allegation of permanent damage to the harbor
tenable in the present advanced state of engineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
science. A London journal, not inferior to any other in
character and ability, has recently recognized the normal
character of such a proceeding by mentioning it as a
possible defence for Calcutta against naval force, saying:
“The ascent of the river without pilots is impossible;
for the Government can alter all the channels in a
night by <i>merely sinking a couple of loaded schooners</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
In common times her Majesty’s Government would
shrink from such intermeddling. It could not forget
that history, early and late, and especially English history,
abounds in similar incidents: that, as long ago as
1436, at the siege of Calais by the Duke of Burgundy,
and also in 1628, at the memorable siege of Rochelle
by Cardinal Richelieu, ships laden with stone were
sunk in the harbor; that, during the war of the Revolution,
in 1779, six vessels were sunk by the British
commander in the Savannah River, not far from this
very Charleston, as a protection against the approach
of the French naval forces; that, in 1804, under direction
of the British Admiralty, there was an attempt, notorious
from contemporary jest,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> to choke the entrance
into the harbor of Boulogne by sinking stone vessels;
and that, in 1809, the same blockade of another port
was recommended to the Admiralty by no less a person
than Lord Dundonald, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> “Ships filled with stones
would ruin forever the anchorage of Aix, and some old
vessels of the line well loaded would be excellent for
the purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This complaint by the British Cabinet
becomes doubly strange, when it is considered that one
of the most conspicuous treaties of modern history contains
solemn exactions from France by England herself,
that the harbor of Dunkirk, whose prosperity was regarded
with jealousy, should be permanently “filled up,”
so that it could no longer furnish those hospitalities
to commerce for which it was famous. This was the
Treaty of Utrecht, in 1713. The Triple Alliance, four
years later, compelled France to stipulate again that
nothing should be omitted “which Great Britain could
think necessary for the entire destruction of the harbor”;
and the latter power was authorized to send commissioners
as “ocular witnesses of the execution of the
treaty.” These humiliating provisions were renewed
in successive treaties down to the Peace of Versailles,
in 1783, when the immunity of that harbor was recognized
with American Independence. And yet it is Great
Britain, thus persistent in closing ports and rivers, that
now interferes to warn us against a stone blockade in
a war to put down Rebel Slavery.</p>

<p>(5.) The same propensity and the same inconsistency
appear in another instance, where an eminent peer, once
Foreign Secretary, did not hesitate, from his place in
Parliament, to charge the United States with making
medicines and surgical instruments contraband, “contrary
to all the common laws of war, <i>contrary to all precedent,
not excluding the most ignorant and barbarous
ages</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Thus exclaims the noble Lord. Now I have
nothing to say of the propriety of making these things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
contraband. My simple object is to exhibit the spirit
against which we are to guard. It is difficult to understand
how such a display could be made in face of the
historic fact, exposed in the satire of Peter Plymley, that
Parliament, in 1808, by large majorities, prohibited the
exportation of Peruvian bark into any territory occupied
by France, and that this prohibition was moved by
no less a person than the Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Mr. Perceval, who commended it on the ground that
“the severest pressure was already felt on the Continent
from the want of that article,” and that “it was of
great importance to the armies of the enemy.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Such, in
an age neither “ignorant” nor “barbarous,” is authentic
British precedent, but now ostentatiously forgotten.</p>

<p>(6.) The same recklessness, of such evil omen, breaks
forth again in a despatch of the Foreign Secretary, where
he undertakes to communicate the judgment of the British
Cabinet on the President’s Proclamation of Emancipation.
Here, at least, you will say there can be no misunderstanding
and no criticism; but you are mistaken.
Under any ordinary circumstances, when great passions
find no vent, such an act, having such an object,
and being of such unparalleled importance, would be
treated by the minister of a foreign power with supreme
caution, if not with sympathy; but, under the terrible
influence of the hour, Earl Russell, not content with
condemning the Proclamation, misrepresents it in the
most barefaced manner. This was done in a communication
to Lord Lyons here in Washington. Gathering
his condemnation into one phrase, he says that it
“makes Slavery at once legal and illegal”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; whereas it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
is obvious to the most careless observer, who looks only
at the face of the Proclamation, that, whatever its faults,
it is not obnoxious to this criticism, for it makes Slavery
legal nowhere, while it makes it illegal in an immense
territory. An official letter so incomprehensible in motive,
from a statesman usually liberal, if not cautious, is
another illustration of that irritating tendency which will
be checked, at last, when it is fully comprehended.</p>

<p>(7.) The activity of our navy is only another occasion
for criticism in a similar spirit. Nothing can be done
anywhere to please our self-constituted monitor. Our
naval officers in the West Indies, acting under instructions
modelled on the judgments of the British Admiralty,
are reprehended by Earl Russell in a formal despatch.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The judges in our Prize Court are indecently
belittled by this same minister, from his place in Parliament,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
when it is notorious that there are several who
compare favorably with any British Admiralty judge
since Lord Stowell, not even excepting that noble and
upright magistrate, Dr. Lushington. And this same
minister has undertaken to throw the British shield over
a newly invented contraband trade with the Rebel Slavemongers
<i>viâ</i> Matamoras, claiming that it is “a lawful
branch of commerce” and “a perfectly legitimate trade.”
The “Dolphin” and “Peterhoff” were two ships elaborately
prepared in London for this illicit commerce,
and they have been duly condemned as such; but their
seizure was made the occasion of official protest and
complaint, with the insinuation of “vexatious capture
and arbitrary interference,” followed by the menace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that, under such circumstances, “it is obvious that
Great Britain must interfere to protect her flag.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>(8.) This persistent, inexorable criticism, even at the
expense of all consistency, or of all memory, has broken
forth in forms incompatible with that very “neutrality”
so early declared. It was bad enough to declare neutrality,
when the question was between a friendly power
and an insulting barbarism; but it is worse, after the
declaration, to depart from it, <i>if in words only</i>. The
Court of Rome, at a period when it dictated the usage
of nations, instructed its Cardinal Legate, on an important
occasion, as a solemn duty, first and above all things,
to cultivate “indifference” between the parties, and in
this regard he was to be so exact, that not only should
no partiality be seen in his conduct, but it should not
be remarked even “<i>in the actions and words of his domestics</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
If, in that early day, before steam and telegraph,
or even the newspaper, neutrality was disturbed
by “words,” how much more so now, when every word
is multiplied indefinitely, and wafted we know not whither,
to begin, wherever it falls, a subtle, wide-spread, and
irrepressible influence! This injunction is in plain harmony
with the refined rule of Count Bernstorff, who, in
his admirable despatch at the time of the Armed Neutrality,
says sententiously: “Neutrality does not exist,
<i>when it is not perfect</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> It must be clear and above
suspicion. Like the reputation of a woman, it is lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
when you begin to talk about it. Unhappily, there is
too much occasion to talk about the “neutrality” of
England.</p>

<p>I say nothing of a Parliamentary utterance, that the
national cause was “detested by a large majority of
the House of Commons”; nor do I speak of other most
unneutral speeches. I confine myself to official declarations.
Here the case is plain. Several of the British
Cabinet, including the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, two masters of “words,” have
allowed themselves in public speech to characterize our
present effort to put down Rebel Slavery as “a contest
for empire on one side and for independence on the
other.” Here are “words” which, under a specious
form, openly encouraged Rebel Slavery. But they are
more specious than true, revealing nothing but the side
espoused by the orators. Clearly, on our side it is a
contest for national life, involving the liberty of a race.
Clearly, on the other side it is a contest for Slavery, in
order to secure for this hateful crime <i>new</i> recognition
and power; and it began in rebellion against the solemn
judgment of the American people, declaring, in the
election of Abraham Lincoln, that Slavery shall not
be extended. Our empire is simply to crush Rebel
Slavery. Their independence is but the unrestrained
power to whip and sell women and children. If at the
beginning the National Government made no declaration,
yet the real character of the war was none the less
apparent in the Presidential election, out of which it
grew, and in the repeated declarations of the other side,
who did not hesitate to assert their purpose to build a
<i>new</i> power on Slavery,&mdash;as in the Italian campaign of
Louis Napoleon against Austria the object was necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
apparent, even before the Emperor tardily at
Milan put forth his life-giving proclamation that Italy
should be free from the Alps to the Adriatic, by which
the war became, in its avowed purpose, as well as in
reality, a war of liberation. That such a rebellion should
be elevated by the unneutral “words” of a foreign Cabinet
into respectability which it deserves so little is only
another sign we have to watch.</p>

<p>(9.) These same Cabinet orators, not content with
giving us a bad name, allow themselves to pronounce
against us on the whole case. They declare that the
National Government cannot succeed in crushing Rebel
Slavery, and that dismemberment is inevitable. “Jefferson
Davis,” says one of them, “has created <i>a nation</i>.”
Thus do these representatives of declared “neutrality”
degrade us and exalt Slavery. It is apparent that their
utterance, though made in Parliament and repeated at
public meetings, was founded less on special information
from the seat of war&mdash;disclosing its secret&mdash;than on
political theory, if not prejudice. It is true that our eloquent
teacher, Edmund Burke, in his famous Letter to the
Sheriffs of Bristol, argued most persuasively that Great
Britain could not succeed in reclaiming the colonies
which had declared themselves independent. His reasoning
rather than his wisdom enters into and possesses
the British statesmen of our day, who do not take the
trouble to see how the two cases are so entirely unlike
that the example of the one is not applicable to the
other,&mdash;that the colonies were battling to found a <i>new</i>
power on the corner-stone of Liberty, Equality, and Happiness
to All Men, while our Slavemongers are battling
to found a <i>new</i> power on the corner-stone of Slavery.
The difference becomes a contrast, so that whatever was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
once generously said in favor of American Independence
now tells with unmistakable force against this new-fangled
pretension.</p>

<p>No British statesman saw the past more clearly than
Earl Russell, when, long ago, in striking phrase, he said
that England, in her war against our fathers, “had
engaged <i>for the suppression of Liberty</i>”;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but this is
precisely what Rebel Slavery is doing. Men change,
but principles are the same now as then. Therefore do
I say, that every sympathy formerly bestowed upon our
fathers now belongs to us their children, striving to uphold
their work against bad men, who would not only
break it in pieces, but put in its stead a <i>new</i> piratical
power, whose declared object is “the suppression of
Liberty.” And yet British ministers, mounting the
prophetic tripod, presume most oracularly to foretell
the doom of this Republic. Their prophecies do not
disturb my confidence. I do not forget how often
false prophets have appeared, like the author of the
“Oceana,” who published a demonstration that monarchy
was impossible in England<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> less than six months
before Charles the Second was welcomed to London
amid salvos of cannon and hurrahs of the people. Nor
do I stop to consider how far such prophecies uttered
in public places by British ministers are consistent with
that British “neutrality” so constantly boasted. Opinions
are allies more potent than subsidies, especially in
an age like the present. Prophecies are opinions proclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and projected into the future; and yet these
are given freely to Rebel Slavery. There is matter for
reflection in this instance, but I adduce it only as another
illustration of the times. Nothing is more clear
than that whosoever assumes to play prophet becomes
pledged in character and pretension to sustain his prophecy.
The learned Jerome Cardan, professor and doctor,
also dabbler in astrology, of great fame in the sixteenth
century, undertook to predict the day of his death, and
he maintained his prophetic character by taking his
own life at the appointed time. If British ministers,
playing prophet, escape the ordinary influences of this
craft, it is from that happy nature which suspends for
them human infirmity and human prejudice. But it
becomes us to note well the increased difficulties and
dangers to which, on this account, the national cause
is exposed.</p>

<p>(10.) It is not in “words” only, of speeches, despatches,
or declarations, that our danger lies. I am
sorry to add, that there are acts, also, with which the
British Government is too closely associated. I do not
refer to the unlimited supply of “munitions of war,”
so that our army everywhere, whether at Vicksburg
or Charleston, is compelled to encounter Armstrong
guns and Blakely guns, with all proper ammunition,
from England; for the right of British subjects to sell
these articles to Rebel Slavemongers was fixed, when
the latter, by sudden metamorphosis, were changed from
lawless vagrants of the ocean to lawful belligerents.
Nor do I refer to the swarms of swift steamers, “a
pitchy cloud warping on the eastern wind,” always
under British flag, with contributions to Rebel Slavery;
for these, too, enjoy kindred immunity. Of course no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
royal proclamation can change wrong into right, or
make such business otherwise than immoral; but the
proclamation may take from it the character of felony.</p>

<p>Even the royal manifesto gives no sanction to the
fitting out in England of a <i>naval expedition</i> against the
commerce of the United States. It leaves the Parliamentary
statute, as well as the general Law of Nations,
in full efficacy to restrain and punish such offence.
And yet, in face of this obvious prohibition, standing
forth in the text of the law, and founded in reason
“ere human statute purged the gentle weal,” also
exemplified by the National Government, which, from
the time of Washington, has always guarded its ports
against such outrage, powerful ships are launched,
equipped, fitted out, and manned in England, with
arms supplied at sea from another English vessel, and
then, assuming that by this insulting <i>hocus pocus</i> all
English liability is avoided, they proceed at once to
rob and destroy the commerce of the United States.
<i>England is the naval base</i> from which are derived the
original forces and supplies enabling them to sail the
sea. Several such ships are now depredating on the
ocean, like Captain Kidd, under pretended commissions,
each in itself a <i>naval expedition</i>. As England is not at
war with the United States, these ships can be nothing
else than pirates; and their conduct is that of pirates.
Unable to provide a court for the trial of prizes, they
revive for every captured ship the barbarous Ordeal of
Fire. Like pirates, they burn what they cannot rob.
Raging from sea to sea, they turn the ocean into a furnace
and melting-pot of American commerce. Of these
incendiaries, the most famous is the “Alabama,” with a
picked crew of British seamen, with “trained gunners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
out of her Majesty’s naval reserve,” all, like those of
Queen Elizabeth, described as “good sailors and better
pirates,” and with everything else from keel to truck
British, which, after more than a year of unlawful havoc,
is still firing the property of our citizens, <i>without once
entering a Rebel Slavemonger port</i>, but always keeping
the umbilical connection with England, out of whose
womb she sprung, and never losing the original nationality
stamped upon her by origin, so that, at this day,
she is a British pirate ship, precisely as a native-born
Englishman, robbing on the high seas, and never naturalized
abroad, is a British pirate subject.</p>

<p>It is bad enough that all this should proceed from
England. It is hard to bear. Why is it not stopped at
once? One cruiser might, perhaps, elude a watchful government.
But it is difficult to see how this can occur
once, twice, three times,&mdash;and the cry is, Still they
sail! Two powerful rams are announced, like stars at
a theatre. Will they, also, be allowed to perform? I
wish there were not too much reason to believe that all
these performances are sustained by prevailing British
sympathy. A Frenchman, accidentally prisoner on the
Alabama at the destruction of two American ships, describes
a British packet in sight whose crowded passengers
made the sea resound with cheers, as they witnessed
the captured ships handed over to the flames.
The words of Lucretius were verified:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Suave etiam belli certamina magna tueri.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And these same cheers were echoed in Parliament, as
the builder of the piratical craft gloried in his deed.
The verse which filled the ancient theatre with glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
applause declared sympathy with Humanity<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>; but English
applause is now given to Slavery and its defenders:
“I am an Englishman, and nothing of Slavery is
foreign to me.” Accordingly, Slavery is helped by English
arms, English gold, English ships, English speeches,
English cheers. And yet, for the honor of England be
it known, there are Englishmen who stand firm and
unshaken amidst this painful recreancy. Their names
cannot be forgotten. And still more for the honor of
England be it spoken, the working classes, called to
suffer the most, bravely bear their calamity, without
joining the enemies of the Republic. Their cheers are
for Freedom, and not for Slavery.</p>

<p>But the cheers of the House of Commons prevail in
her Majesty’s Government. Municipal Law is violated,
while International Law, in its most solemn obligation
to do unto others as we would have them do unto us,
is treated as the merest nullity. Eminent British functionaries,
in Court and Parliament, vindicate the <i>naval
expeditions</i> which in the name of Slavery are unleashed
against a friendly power. Taking advantage of an admitted
principle, that, after the concession of belligerent
rights, “munitions of war” may be supplied, the Lord
Chief Baron of the Exchequer tells us that “ships of
war” may be supplied also. Lord Palmerston echoes
Lord Chief Baron. Each vouches American authority.
But they are mistaken. The steel which they
strive to “impel” cannot be feathered from our sides.
Since the earliest stage of its existence, the National
Government has asserted a distinction between the two
cases; and so has the Supreme Court, although there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
are words of Story latterly quoted to the contrary. The
authority of the Supreme Court is positive on the two
points into which the British apology is divided. The
first is, that, even if a “ship of war” cannot be furnished,
the offence is incomplete until the armament is
put aboard, so that, where the ship, though fitted out and
equipped in a British port, awaits an armament at sea,
she is not liable to arrest. Such apology is an insult
to the understanding and to common sense,&mdash;as if it
were not obvious that the offence begins with the laying
of the keel for the hostile ship, <i>knowing it to be such</i>:<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and in this spirit the Supreme Court has decided that
it is not necessary to find that a ship on leaving port
was armed, or in a condition to commit hostilities; for
citizens are restrained from such acts as are calculated
to involve the country in war.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The second apology
assumes, that, even if the armament were aboard, so
that the “ship of war” is complete at all points, still
the expedition would be lawful, if the fiction of a sale
were adroitly managed. On this point, the Supreme
Court, speaking by Chief-Justice Marshall, has left no
doubt of its deliberate and most authoritative judgment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
In the case before the Court the armament was
aboard, but cleared as cargo; the men, too, were aboard,
but enlisted for a commercial voyage; the ship, though
fitted out to cruise against a nation with which we were
at peace, was not commissioned as a privateer, and
did not attempt to act as such, until she reached the
river La Plata, <i>where a commission was obtained and the
crew reënlisted</i>; yet, in the face of these extenuating
circumstances, it was declared by the whole Court, that
the neutrality of the United States had been violated,
so that the guilty ship could not afterwards be recognized
as a legitimate cruiser. All the disguises were to
no purpose. The Court penetrated them every one, saying,
that, if such a ship could lawfully sail, there would
be on our part “a fraudulent neutrality, disgraceful to
our own Government, and of which no nation would
be the dupe.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> But a “neutrality” worse even than
that condemned in advance by our Supreme Court, “of
which no nation would be the dupe,” is now served out
to us, which nothing can explain, short of the fatal war-spirit
that has entered into Great Britain. There was a
time when the Foreign Secretary of England, truly eminent
as statesman and orator, Mr. Canning, said in the
House of Commons: “If a war must come, let it come
in the shape of satisfaction to be demanded for injuries,
of rights to be asserted, of interests to be protected, of
treaties to be fulfilled. <i>But, in God’s name, let it not
come on in the paltry, pettifogging way of fitting out ships
in our harbors to cruise for gain. At all events, let the
country disdain to be sneaked into a war.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> These noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
words were uttered in reply to Lord John Russell and
his associates in 1823, when trying to repeal the Foreign
Enlistment Act, and to overturn the statute safeguards
of British neutrality. They speak now with greater
force even than then.</p>

<p>Though it be admitted that “ships of war,” like
“munitions of war,” may be sold to a belligerent, as
is asserted by the British Prime-Minister, echoing the
Lord Chief Baron, it is obvious that it can be only
with the distinction already mentioned, that the sale
is a <i>commercial transaction</i>, pure and simple, and not in
any respect a <i>hostile expedition</i> fitted out in England.
The ship must be “exported” as an <i>article of commerce</i>,
and must continue such <i>until</i> arrival at the belligerent
port, where alone can it be fitted out and commissioned
as a “ship of war,” when its hostile character will commence.
Any attempt in England to impart a hostile
character to the ship, or, in one word, to make England
its <i>naval base</i>, must be criminal: but this is precisely
what has been done. Ships are sent forth, armed and
equipped. And, pray, how distinguish a ship armed
and equipped from a regiment armed and equipped?
It is not a munition, it is not even an article, but much
more; and here is the distinction not to be overlooked.
It is an <i>organized force</i>, and the nation sending it forth
makes itself a party to the war,&mdash;all of which England
has done. And here are the leonine footprints which
point so badly.</p>

<p>(11.) Not content with misconstruing the decisions
of our Supreme Court, making them a cover for <i>naval
expeditions</i> to depredate on our commerce, our whole history
is forgotten or misrepresented. It is forgotten, that,
as early as 1793, under the administration of Washington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
before any Act of Congress on the subject, the
National Government recognized its liability, under the
Law of Nations, for ships fitted out in its ports to depredate
on British commerce; that Washington, in his
speech at the opening of Congress, describes such ships
as “vessels commissioned or <i>equipped in a warlike form</i>
within the limits of the United States,” and also as
“military expeditions or enterprises”;<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and that Jefferson,
vindicating this policy of <i>repression</i>, said, in a
letter to the French Minister, that it was “our wish
to preserve the morals of our citizens from being vitiated
by courses of lawless plunder and murder”;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that,
on this occasion, the National Government made the
distinction between “munitions of war,” which a neutral
might supply in the way of commerce to a belligerent,
and “ships of war,” which a neutral was not
allowed to supply or even to augment with arms;
that Mr. Hammond, the British plenipotentiary at that
time, by his letter of 8th May, 1793, after complaining
of two French privateers, fitted out at Charleston to
cruise against British commerce, expressly declares that
“he conceives them to be breaches of that neutrality
which the United States profess to observe, and direct
contraventions of the proclamation which the President
issued,”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and that very soon there were criminal proceedings,
at British instigation, on account of these privateers,
in which it was affirmed by the Court that such
ships could not be fitted out in a neutral port without
violation of international obligations; that promptly, on
the representation of the British Government, a statute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
was enacted by Congress, in harmony with the Law of
Nations, for the better maintenance of our neutrality;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
that, in 1818, another statute followed in the nature of
a Foreign Enlistment Act,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> afterwards proposed as an
example by Lord Castlereagh, when urging a similar
statute upon Parliament;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> that, in 1823, the conduct
of the United States on this whole head was presented
as a model by Mr. Canning;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> that, in 1838, during
the rebellion in Canada, on the appeal of the British
Government, and to its special satisfaction, as was announced
in Parliament by Lord Palmerston, at the time
Foreign Secretary, our Government promptly declared
its purpose “to maintain the supremacy of those laws
which were passed to fulfil the obligations of the United
States to all friendly nations who may be unfortunately
engaged in foreign or domestic war,” and, not satisfied
with existing powers, undertook to ask additional legislation
from Congress; that Congress proceeded at once
to the enactment of another statute, calculated to meet
the immediate exigency, where it is provided that collectors,
marshals, and other officers shall “seize and detain
<i>any vessel</i> or any arms or munitions of war which
may be provided or prepared for <i>any military expedition</i>
or enterprise against the territory or dominions of any
foreign prince or state.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It is something to forget these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
things; but it is convenient to forget still further, that,
at the Crimean War, in 1854, the British Government,
jointly with France, made another appeal to the United
States, that our citizens should “rigorously abstain from
taking part in armaments of Russian privateers, or in
any other measure opposed to the duties of a strict neutrality”;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
and this appeal, declared by the British Government
to be “in the spirit of just reciprocity,” was
answered on our part by a sincere and determined vigilance,
so that not a single British or French ship suffered
from any cruiser fitted out in our ports. And it is also
convenient to forget no less the solemn obligations of
treaty, binding both parties:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the subjects and citizens of the two nations <i>shall
not do any acts of hostility or violence against each other</i>, nor
accept commissions or instructions so to act from any foreign
prince or state, enemies to the other party; nor shall the
enemies of one of the parties be permitted to invite or endeavor
to enlist in their military service any of the subjects
or citizens of the other party; <i>and the laws against all such
offences and aggressions shall be punctually executed</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At the date of this treaty, in 1794, there was little
legislation on the subject in either country; so that
the treaty, in harmony with the practice, testifies to
the requirements of the Law of Nations as understood
at the time by both powers.</p>

<p>And yet, disregarding all these things, which show
how faithfully the National Government has acted, both
in measures of <i>repression</i> and measures of <i>compensation</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
also how often the British Government asked and received
protection at our hands, and how highly our
example of neutrality has been appreciated by leading
British statesmen,&mdash;and disowning, also, that “spirit
of just reciprocity,” which, besides being the prompting
of an honest nature, has been positively promised, ship
after ship is permitted to leave British ports to depredate
on our commerce; and when we complain of an
outrage so unprecedented and so unjustifiable, all the
obligations of International Law are ignored, and we
are petulantly told that the evidence against the ships
is not sufficient <i>under the statute</i>; and when we propose
that the statute shall be rendered efficient for the purpose,&mdash;precisely
as in past times the British Government,
under circumstances less stringent, proposed to
us,&mdash;we are pointedly repelled by the old baronial
declaration, that there must be no change in the laws
of England,&mdash;“<i>nolumus leges Angliæ mutari</i>”; while, to
cap this strange insensibility, Lord Palmerston, in a last
debate of the late Parliament, brings against us a groundless
charge of infidelity to neutral duties during the
Crimean War,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> when the fact is notoriously the reverse,
and Earl Russell, in the same spirit, imagines an equally
groundless charge, which he records in one of his diplomatic
notes, that we have recently enlisted men in Ireland,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
when notoriously we have done no such thing.
Thus are the obligations of reciprocal service and good-will
openly discarded, while our public conduct, as well
in the past as the present, is openly misrepresented.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>(12.) This flagrant oblivion of history and of duty,
which seems the adopted policy of the British Government,
is characteristically followed by flat refusal
to pay for the damages to our commerce caused by
the hostile expeditions. The United States, with Washington
as President, on application of the British Government,
made compensation for damages to British
commerce under circumstances much less vexatious,&mdash;and,
still further, by special treaty, made compensation
for damages “by vessels originally armed” in our
ports,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>&mdash;which is the present case. Of course it can
make no difference, not a pin’s difference, if the armament
is carried out to sea in another vessel from a British
port and there transshipped. Such an elaborate
evasion may be effectual against a Parliamentary statute,
but it must be impotent against a demand upon
the British Government, according to the principles of
International Law; for this law looks always at <i>substance</i>,
and not <i>form</i>, and will not be diverted by the trick of
a pettifogger. Whether the armament be put on board
in port or at sea, England is always the <i>naval base</i>, or,
according to the language of Sir William Scott in a memorable
case, the “station” or “vantage-ground,” which
he declared a neutral country could not be.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Therefore
the early precedent between the United States and England
is in every respect completely applicable; and since
this precedent was established <i>not only by the consent of
England, but at her motion</i>, it must be accepted on the
present occasion as an irreversible declaration of international
duty. Other nations might differ, but England
is bound. And now it is her original interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
first made to take compensation from us, which is flatly
rejected when we ask compensation from her. Even if
the responsibility for <i>a hostile expedition</i> fitted out in
British ports were not plain, there is something in the
recent conduct of the British Government calculated
to remove all doubt. Pirate ships are reported on the
stocks ready to be launched, and when the Parliamentary
statute is declared insufficient to stop them, the
British Government declines to amend it, and, so doing,
openly declines to stop the pirate ships, saying, “If the
Parliamentary statute is inadequate, then let them sail.”
It is not needful to consider the apology. The act of
declension is positive, and its consequences are no less
positive, <i>fixing beyond question the responsibility of the
British Government for these criminal expeditions</i>. Thus
fixing the responsibility, we but follow the suggestions
of reason and the text of an approved authority, whose
words have been adopted in England.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>It must be laid down as a maxim</i>, that a sovereign, who,
knowing the crimes of his subjects, as, for example, that
they <i>practice piracy</i> on strangers, and, being also able and
obliged to hinder it, does not hinder it, <i>renders himself criminal,
because he has consented to the bad action, the commission
of which he has permitted</i>.… It is presumed that a sovereign
knows what his subjects openly and frequently commit;
and <i>as to his power of hindering the evil, this likewise is
always presumed</i>, unless the want of it be clearly proved.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such are the words of Burlamaqui, in his work on
Political Law, quoted with approbation by Phillimore,
in his work on the Law of Nations.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Unless these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
words are discarded as “a maxim,” while the early precedent
of British demand upon us is also rudely rejected,
it is difficult to see how the British Government can
avoid the consequences of complicity with the pirate
ships in all their lawless devastation. I forbear to
dwell on this accumulating liability, amounting already
to many millions of dollars, with accumulating exasperations
also. My present object is accomplished, if
I make you see which way danger lies.</p>

<p>(13.) Beyond acts and words, this same British <i>rabbia</i>
shows itself in the official tone towards the national
cause in its unparalleled struggle, especially throughout
the correspondence of the British Foreign Office. There
is little friendship in any of these letters. Nor is there
any sympathy with the national championship against
Rebel Slavery, nor even one word of mildest dissent
from the miscreant apocalypse preached in its behalf.
Naturally the tone is in harmony with the sentiment.
Hard, curt, captious, cynical, it evinces indifference to
that kindly intercourse which nations ought to cultivate
with each other, and which should be the study of a
wise statesmanship. The Malay <i>runs amuck</i>, and such
is the British diplomatic style in dealing with us. This
is painfully conspicuous in all that concerns the pirate
ships. But I can well understand that a Secretary conceding
belligerent rights to Rebel Slavery so easily, and
then so easily permitting its ships to sally forth for piracy,
would be very indifferent to the tone of what he
wrote. And yet, even outrage may be soothed or softened
by gentle words; but none such come out of British
diplomacy to us. Most deeply do I regret this too
suggestive failure. And believe me, fellow-citizens, I
say these things with sorrow unspeakable, and only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
discharge of my duty, when, face to face, I meet you
to consider the aspects of our affairs abroad.</p>

<p>(14.) There is still another head of danger, in which
all others culminate. I refer to intrusive mediation,
or, it may be, recognition of the Slavemonger attempt
as an independent nation,&mdash;for such movements have
been made openly in Parliament and urged constantly
by the British press, and, though not yet adopted by
her Majesty’s Government, have never been repelled
on principle, so that they constitute a perpetual cloud
threatening to break. It is plain to all who have not
forgotten history, that England never can be guilty of
such recognition without unpardonable apostasy; nor
can she intervene by way of mediation, except in the
interests of Freedom. And yet such are the “elective
affinities” newly born between England and Slavery,
such is the wilful blindness with regard to our country,
kindred to that which prevailed in the time of
George Grenville and Lord North, that her Majesty’s
Government, instead of repelling the proposition, simply
adjourn it, adopting meanwhile the attitude of one
watching to strike. The British Minister at Washington,
of model prudence, whose individual desire for peace
I cannot doubt, tells his Government, in a despatch
found in the last Blue Book, that as yet he sees no sign
of “a conjuncture at which foreign powers <i>may step in
with propriety</i> and effect to put a stop to the effusion
of blood.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Here is the plain assumption that such conjuncture
may occur. For the present we are left free to
wage the battle against Slavery without any such intervention
in arrest of the national efforts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are some of the warnings which lower from
the English sky arching the graves of Wilberforce and
Clarkson, while sounding above these sacred resting-places
are heard strange, un-English voices, crying out:
“Come unto us, Rebel Slavemongers, whippers of women
and sellers of children!&mdash;for you are the people of
our choice, whom we welcome promptly to <i>ocean rights</i>,
with Armstrong guns and <i>naval expeditions</i> equipped in
our ports, and on whom we lavish sympathy always
and the prophecy of success; while for you who uphold
the Republic and oppose Slavery we have hard words,
criticism, rebuke, and the menace of war!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Crossing the Channel into France, we are not encouraged
much. And yet the Emperor, though acting habitually
in concert with the British Cabinet, has not intermeddled
so illogically or displayed a temper of so little
international amiability. The correspondence under his
direction, even at the most critical moments, leaves little
to be desired in respect of form. Nor has there been
a single blockade-runner under the French flag, nor a
single pirate ship from a French port. But, in spite
of these things, it is too apparent that the Emperor
has taken sides against us in at least four important
public acts, positively, plainly, offensively. The Duc
de Choiseul, Prime-Minister of France, was addressed
by Frederick of Prussia as “Coachman of Europe,”&mdash;a
title which belongs now to Louis Napoleon. But he
must not try to be “coachman of America.”</p>

<p>(1.) Following the example of England, Louis Napoleon
acknowledges the Rebel Slavemongers as <i>ocean</i> belligerents,
so that, with the sanction of France, our ancient
ally, their pirate ships, although without a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
open port which they can call their own, enjoy complete
immunity as lawful cruisers, while all who sympathize
with them furnish supplies and munitions of war. This
fatal concession was aggravated by the concurrence of
the two great powers. But, God be praised, their joint
act, though capable of giving brief vitality to Slavery
on pirate decks, is impotent to confirm the intolerable
pretension.</p>

<p>(2.) Sinister events are not alone, and this recognition
of Slavery was followed by an expedition of France,
in concurrence with England and Spain, against our
neighbor Republic, Mexico. The two latter powers very
soon withdrew, but the Emperor, less wise, did not hesitate
at invasion. A French fleet, with an unmatched
iron-clad,&mdash;the consummate product of French naval
art,&mdash;is now at Vera Cruz, and the French army, after
a protracted siege, has stormed Puebla and entered the
famous capital. This far-reaching enterprise was originally
declared to be nothing more than process, served
by a general, for the recovery of outstanding debts due
to French citizens. But the Emperor, in a mystic letter
to General Forey, gives it another character. He
proposes nothing less than the restoration of the Latin
race on this side of the Atlantic, and more than intimates
that the United States must be restrained in
power and influence over the Gulf of Mexico and the
Antilles. And now the Archduke Maximilian of Austria
is proclaimed Emperor of Mexico under the protection
of France. It is obvious that this imperial
invasion, though only indirectly against us, would not
have been made, if our convulsions had not left the
door of the Continent ajar, so that foreign powers may
bravely enter in. And it is more obvious that this attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
to plant a throne by our side would “have died
before it saw the light,” had it not been supposed that
Rebel Slavery was about to triumph.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Plainly the whole
transaction is connected with our affairs. But it can be
little more than a transient experiment; for who can
doubt that this imperial exotic, planted by foreign care
and propped by foreign bayonets, must disappear before
the ascending glory of the Republic?</p>

<p>(3.) This enterprise of war was followed by an enterprise
of diplomacy not less hardy. The Emperor, not
content with stirring against us the Gulf of Mexico, the
Antilles, and the Latin race, entered upon work of a
different character. He invited England and Russia
to unite with France in tendering to the two “belligerents”
(such is the equal designation of our Republic and
the embryo Slavemonger mockery!) a joint mediation
to procure “an armistice for six months, during which
every act of war, direct or indirect, should provisionally
cease on sea as well as on land, to be renewed, if necessary,
for a further period.” The Cabinets of England and
Russia, better inspired, declined the invitation, which
looked to little short of recognition itself. Under the
proposed armistice, all our vast operations must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
been suspended, the blockade itself must have ceased,
while the Rebel ports were opened on the one side
to unlimited supplies and military stores, and on the
other to unlimited exports of cotton. Trade, for the
time, would have been legalized in these ports, and
Slavery would have lifted its grinning front before the
civilized world. Not disheartened by this failure, the
Emperor alone pushed forward his diplomatic enterprise
against us, as alone he had pushed forward his military
enterprise against Mexico, and presented to our Government
the unsupported mediation of France. His
offer was promptly rejected by the President. By solemn
resolutions of both Houses, adopted with singular
unanimity, and communicated since to all foreign governments,
Congress announced that such a proposition
could be attributed only to “a misunderstanding of the
true state of the question, and of the real character of
the war in which the Republic is engaged”; and that
it was in its nature so far injurious to the national interests
that Congress would be obliged to consider its repetition
an unfriendly act.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This strong language frankly
states the true position of our country. Any such offer,
whatever its motive, must be an encouragement to the
Rebellion. In an age when ideas prevail and even
words become things, the simple declarations of statesmen
are of incalculable importance. But the head of
a great nation is more than statesman in such influence.
The imperial proposition tended directly to the dismemberment
of the Republic and the substitution of a
ghastly Slavemonger nation.</p>

<p>Baffled in this effort twice attempted, the Emperor
does not yet abandon his policy. We are told that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
is “postponed to a more suitable opportunity”; so that
he, too, waits to strike, if the Gallic cock does not sound
alarm in an opposite quarter. Meanwhile the development
of the Mexican expedition shows too clearly the
motive of mediation. It was all one transaction. Mexico
was invaded for empire, and mediation was proposed
to help the plot. But the invasion must fail with the
diplomacy to which it is allied.</p>

<p>(4.) The policy of the French Emperor towards our
Republic is not left to uncertain inference. For a long
time public report has pronounced him unfriendly, and
now public report is confirmed by what he does and
says. The ambassadorial attorney of Rebel Slavery is
received at the Tuileries, members of Parliament on an
errand of hostility to our cause are received at Fontainebleau,
and the open declaration is made that the
Emperor desires to recognize Rebel Slavery as an independent
power. This is hard to believe, but it is too
true. The French Emperor is against us. In an evil
hour, under temptations which should be scouted, he
forgets the precious traditions of France, whose blood
commingled with ours in a common cause; he forgets
the swords of Lafayette and Rochambeau, flashing side
by side with the swords of Washington and the earlier
Lincoln, while the lilies of the ancient monarchy floated
together with the stars of our infant flag; he forgets
that early alliance, sealed by Franklin, which gave to
the Republic the assurance of national life, and made
France the partner of her rising glory;&mdash;“<i>Heu pietas!
heu prisca fides! Manibus date lilia plenis!</i>”&mdash;and he
forgets still more the obligations of his own name,&mdash;how
the first Napoleon surrendered to us Louisiana and
the whole region west of the Mississippi, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> “This
accession of territory establishes forever the power of
the United States, and gives to England a maritime
rival destined to humble her pride”;<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and he forgets,
also, how he himself, when beginning intervention for
Italian liberty, boasted proudly that France always stood
for an “idea”; and forgetting these things, which mankind
cannot forget, he seeks the disjunction of this Republic,
with the spoliation of that very territory which
came to us with such auspices, while France, always
standing for an “idea,” stands, under the second Napoleon,
for the “idea” of welcome to a new evangel of
Slavery, with Mason and Slidell as the evangelists.
Thus is imperial influence exerted for Rebel Slavemongers.
The Emperor, for the present, forbears to
fling his sword into the scale; but he flings his heavy
hand, if not his sword.</p>

<p>Only recently we have the menace of the sword.
The throne of Mexico is offered to an Austrian archduke.
The desire to recognize the independence of
Rebel Slavery is openly declared. These two incidents
together are complements of each other. And
now we are assured by concurring report, that Mexico
is to be maintained as an empire. The policy
of the Holy Alliance, originally organized against the
great Napoleon, is adopted by his representative on the
throne of France. What its despot authors left undone
the present Emperor, nephew of the first, proposes to accomplish.
Report informs us that Texas also is doomed
to the imperial protectorate, thus ravishing a possession
which belongs to this Republic as much as Normandy
belongs to France.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The partition of Poland is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
acknowledged to be the great crime of the last century.
It was accomplished by three powers, with the silent
connivance of the rest, but not without pangs of remorse
in one of the spoilers. “I know,” said Maria Theresa
to the ambassador of Louis the Sixteenth, “that I have
brought a deep stain on my reign by what has been
done in Poland; but I am sure that I should be forgiven,
if it could be known what repugnance I had to
it.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Here on this Continent the French Emperor seeks
to play the very part which of old caused the contrition
of Maria Theresa; nor could the partition of our
broad country&mdash;if, in an evil hour, it were accomplished&mdash;fail
to be the great crime of the present century.
Trampler upon the Republic in France, trampler
upon the Republic in Mexico, it remains to be seen if
the French Emperor can prevail as trampler upon this
Republic. I do not think he can; nor am I anxious
on account of this new-found Emperor, who will be
another King Canute against the rising tide of the
American people. His chair must be withdrawn, or
he will be overwhelmed.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I bring to an end this unpleasant review. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
is with little satisfaction, and only in explanation of our
relations with foreign powers, that I accumulate these
instances, not one of which, small or great, is without
its painful lesson, while they all testify with a single
voice to the perils of our country.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>Another branch of the subject is not less important.
Considering all these things, and especially how great
powers abroad constantly menace intervention, now by
criticism and then by proffer of mediation, all tending
painfully to something further, it becomes us to see
what, according to International Law and the examples
of history, will justify foreign intervention, in any of the
forms it may take. And here there is one remark to be
made at the outset. Nations are equal in the eye of
International Law, so that what is right for one is right
for all. It follows that no nation can justly exercise
any right which it is not bound to concede under like
circumstances. Therefore, should our cases be reversed,
there is nothing England and France now propose, or
may hereafter propose, which it will not be our equal
right to propose, when Ireland or India once more rebels,
or when France is in the throes of its next revolution.
Generously, and for the sake of that international
comity not lightly hazarded, we may reject the
precedents they furnish; but it will be difficult for
them to complain, if we follow their steps.</p>

<p>Foreign intervention is, on its face, inconsistent with
every idea of national independence, which in itself is
the natural and acknowledged right of a nation to rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
undisturbed so long as it does not disturb others. If
nations stood absolutely alone, dissociated from each
other, so that what passed in one had little or no influence
in another, only a tyrannical or intermeddling
spirit could fail to recognize this right. But civilization,
drawing nations nearer together and into one society,
brings them under reciprocal influence, so that
no nation can now act or suffer alone. Out of the
relations and suggestions of good neighborhood, involving
the admitted right of self-defence, springs the only
justification or apology to be found for <i>foreign intervention</i>,
which is the general term to signify interposition
in the affairs of another country, whatever form
it may take. Much is done under the name of “good
offices,” whether in the form of mediation or intercession,&mdash;and
much also by military power, whether in
the declared will of superior force or directly by arms.
Recognition of independence is also another instance.
Intervention in any form is interference. If peaceable,
it must be judged by its motive and tendency; if forcible,
it will naturally be resisted by force.</p>

<p>Intervention may be between two or more nations, or
between the two parties to a civil war; and yet again,
it may be where there is no war, foreign or domestic.
In each case it is governed by the same principles, except,
perhaps, that in the case of civil war there should
be more careful consideration, not only of the rights, but
of the susceptibilities of a nation so severely tried. Such
is the obvious suggestion of humanity. Intervention between
nations is only a common form of participation
in foreign war, but intervention in a civil war is intermeddling
in the domestic concerns of another nation.
Whoever acts at the <i>joint invitation</i> of belligerent parties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to compose a bloody strife is entitled to the blessings
which belong to the peacemakers; but, if uninvited,
or acting at the invitation of one party only,
he will be careful to proceed with reserve and tenderness,
in the spirit of peace, and confining action to a
proffer of good offices in the form of mediation or intercession,
unless he is ready for war. Such proffer may
be declined without offence. But it can never be forgotten,
that, <i>where one side is obviously fighting for Barbarism</i>,
any intervention, whatever form it takes,&mdash;if
only by captious criticism, calculated to encourage the
wrong side, or to secure for it time or temporary toleration,
if not final success,&mdash;<i>is plainly immoral</i>. If not
contrary to the Law of Nations, it ought to be.</p>

<p>Intervention in the spirit of peace and for the sake of
peace belongs to the refinements of modern civilization.
Intervention in the spirit of war, if not for the sake of
war, has filled a large space in history, ancient and
modern. But all these instances may be grouped under
two heads: first, intervention in <i>external</i> affairs; and,
secondly, intervention in <i>internal</i> affairs. The first is
illustrated by the intervention of the Elector Maurice
of Saxony against Charles the Fifth, of King William
against Louis the Fourteenth, of Russia and France in
the Seven Years’ War, of Russia again between France
and Austria in 1805, and also between France and
Prussia in 1806, and of France, Great Britain, and Sardinia
between Turkey and Russia in the war of the
Crimea.</p>

<p>The intervention of Russia, Austria, and Prussia in
the affairs of Poland, of Great Britain among the native
provinces of India, and of the Allied Powers in the
French Revolution, under the continued inspiration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
the Treaty of Pilnitz, are illustrations of the second
head. Without dwelling on these great examples, I
shall call attention to instances showing more especially
the growth of intervention, first in external, and then
in internal affairs. Here I shall conceal nothing. Instances
seeming against the principles I have at heart
will at least help illustrate the great subject, so that
you may see it as it is.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(1.) First in order, and for the sake of completeness,
I speak of intervention in <i>external</i> affairs, where two or
more nations are parties.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1645, France offered mediation between
what were then called “The Two Crowns of the
North,” Sweden and Denmark. This was followed, in
1648, by the famous Peace of Westphalia, the beginning
of our present Law of Nations, negotiated under
the joint mediation of the Pope and the Republic of
Venice, present by nuncio and ambassador. In 1655,
the Emperor of Germany offered mediation between
Sweden and Poland; but the old historian records
that the Swedes suspected him of seeking to increase
rather than to arrange pending difficulties; and the
effort ended by the withdrawal of the imperial envoy
into the Polish camp. Sweden, though often belligerent
in those days, was not so always, and, in 1672,
when war broke forth between France and England
on one side and the Dutch Provinces on the other,
we find her proffering mediation, which was promptly
accepted by England, who justly rejected a similar proffer
most hardily made by the Elector of Brandenburg,
ancestor of the kings of Prussia, while marching at the
head of his forces to join the Dutch. The English note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
on this occasion, written in what at the time was called
“sufficiently bad French, but in very intelligible terms,”
declared that the Electoral proffer, though under the
pleasant name of mediation (<i>par le doux nom de médiation</i>),
was adjudged to be only arbitration, and that,
instead of mediation <i>unarmed and disinterested</i>, it was
mediation armed and pledged to the enemies of England.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>Such are earlier instances, all of which have their
lessons for us. There are modern, also. I allude only
to the Triple Alliance, between Great Britain, Prussia,
and Holland, which, at the close of the last century,
successively intervened, by mediation which could not
be resisted, to compel Denmark, while siding with Russia
against Sweden, to remain neutral for the rest of the
war,&mdash;then, in 1791, to dictate terms of peace between
Austria and the Porte,&mdash;and lastly, in 1792, to constrain
Russia into abandonment of her designs upon the Turkish
Empire by the Peace of Jassy. On this occasion, the
Russian Empress, Catharine the Second, peremptorily refused
the mediation of Prussia, and the mediating Alliance
made its approaches through Denmark, by whose
good offices the Empress was finally induced to accept
the treaty. While thus engaged in professed mediation,
England, in a note to the French ambassador, declined
to act as mediator between France and the Allied Powers,
leaving that world-embracing war to proceed. Not only
has England refused to act as mediator, but <i>also refused
submission to mediation</i>. This was during the last war
with the United States, when Russia, at that time the
ally of England, proffered mediation between the two
belligerents, which was promptly accepted by the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
States. Its rejection by England, causing the prolongation
of hostilities, was considered by Sir James Mackintosh
less justifiable, as “a mediator is a common friend,
who counsels both parties with a weight proportioned
to their belief in his integrity and their respect for his
power; but he is not an arbitrator, to whose decision
they submit their differences, and whose award is binding
on them.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The Peace of Ghent was concluded at
last under Russian mediation. But England has not
always been belligerent. When Andrew Jackson menaced
letters of marque against France, on account of
failure to pay a sum stipulated in a recent treaty with
the United States, King William the Fourth proffered
mediation; but happily the whole question was already
virtually arranged. It appears, also, that, before our war
with Mexico, the good offices of England were tendered
to the two parties; but neither was willing to accept
them, and war took its course.</p>

<p>Such are instances of interference in external affairs;
and since International Law is traced in history, they
furnish a guide we cannot now neglect, especially when
we regard the actual policy of England and France.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>(2.) Instances of foreign intervention in the <i>internal</i>
affairs of a nation are more pertinent. They are numerous,
and not always harmonious, especially if we compare
the new with the old. In the earlier times such
intervention was regarded with repugnance. But the
principle then declared has been sapped on the one side
by the conspiracies of tyranny seeking the suppression
of liberal institutions, and on the other by a generous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
sympathy breaking forth from time to time in their
support. According to old precedents, most of which
are found in the gossipping book of Wicquefort,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> whence
they have been copied by Mr. Wildman, in his “Institutes
of International Law,”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> even <i>foreign intercession</i>
was prohibited. Not even in the name of charity could
one ruler speak to another on the domestic affairs of his
government. Peter, King of Aragon, was astonished at
a proposed embassy from Alphonso, King of Castile, entreating
mercy for rebels. Charles the Ninth of France,
a detestable monarch, in reply to ambassadors of the
Protestant princes of Germany, pleading for his Protestant
subjects, insolently declared that he required no
tutors to teach him how to rule. And yet this same
sovereign did not hesitate to ask the Duke of Savoy to
receive certain subjects “into his benign favor, and to restore
and reëstablish them in their confiscated estates.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
In this appeal there was a double inconsistency; for it
was not only interference in the affairs of another prince,
but it was in behalf of Protestants, only a few months
before the Massacre of St. Bartholomew. Henry the
Third, successor of Charles, and another detestable monarch,
in reply to the Protestant ambassadors, announced
that he was a sovereign prince, and ordered them to
leave his dominions. Louis the Thirteenth was of milder
nature, and yet, when the English ambassador, the Earl
of Carlisle, presumed to speak in favor of the Huguenots,
he intimated that no interference between the
King of France and his subjects could be approved.
The Cardinal Richelieu, who governed France so long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
learning that an attempt was made to procure the intercession
of the Pope, stopped it by a message to his
Holiness, that the King would be displeased by any
such interference. The Pope himself, on another recorded
occasion, admitted that it would be a pernicious
precedent for a subject to negotiate terms of accommodation
through a foreign prince. On still another occasion,
when the King of France, forgetting his own rule,
interposed in behalf of the Barberini family, Innocent
the Tenth declared, that, having no desire to interfere
in the affairs of France, he trusted his Majesty would
not interfere in his. Queen Christina of Sweden, merely
hinting a disposition to proffer good offices for the settlement
of the unhappy divisions in France, was told by
the Queen Regent that she need give herself no trouble
about them, and one of her own ministers at Stockholm
declared that the overture was properly rejected. Nor
were the States General of Holland less sensitive. They
even refused audience to the Spanish ambassador seeking
to congratulate them on the settlement of a domestic
question; and when the French ambassador undertook
to plead for Roman Catholics, the States, by formal
resolution, denounced his conduct as inconsistent with
the peace and constitution of the Republic, all of which
was communicated to him by eight deputies, who added
in speech whatever the resolution seemed to want in
plainness.</p>

<p>Nor is England without similar example. Louis the
Thirteenth, shortly after the marriage of his sister Henrietta
Maria with Charles the First, consented that the
English ambassadors should interpose for French Protestants;
but when the French ambassador in England
requested the repeal of a law against Roman Catholics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Charles expressed his surprise that the King of France
should presume to intermeddle in English affairs. Even
as late as 1746, when, after the Battle of Culloden, the
Dutch ambassador in France was induced to address
the British Government in behalf of the unfortunate
Charles Edward, to the effect, that, if taken, he should
not be treated as a rebel, it is recorded that this intercession
was greatly resented by the British Government,
which, not content with apology from the unfortunate
official, required that he should be rebuked by his
own Government also.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> And this is British testimony
with regard to intervention in a civil war, even when
it took the mildest form of intercession for the life of
a prince.</p>

<p>In face of such repulses, all these nations, at different
times, practised intervention in every variety of form,&mdash;sometimes
by intercession or “good offices” only, sometimes
by mediation, and often by arms. Even these instances
attest the intermeddling spirit; for such intervention,
however received, was at least attempted.</p>

<p>Two precedents belonging to the earlier period deserve
to stand apart, not only for historic importance, but for
applicability to our times. The first was the effort to
institute mediation between King Charles the First and
his Parliament, attempted by Cardinal Mazarin, that
powerful minister, who, during the minority of Louis
the Fourteenth, swayed France. The civil war had
been waged for years; good men on each side had
fallen,&mdash;Falkland fighting for the King, and Hampden
fighting for the Parliament,&mdash;and other costliest blood
been shed on the fields of Edgehill, Newbury, Marston
Moor, and Naseby, when the ambitious Cardinal, wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
to serve the King, promised, as Clarendon relates,
“to press the Parliament so imperiously, and to denounce
a war against them, if they refused to yield to what was
reasonable.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> For this important service he selected
the famous Pomponne de Bellièvre, of a family tried in
public duties,&mdash;himself President of the Parliament of
Paris and peer of France,&mdash;conspicuous in personal
qualities as in place, whose beautiful head, preserved
by the graver of Nanteuil, is illustrious in Art, and
whose dying charity lives still in the great hospital
of the Hôtel Dieu, at Paris. Arriving at London, the
graceful ambassador presented himself to that Long Parliament
which knew so well how to guard English rights.
At once every overture was rejected in formal proceedings,
from which I copy these words: “We do declare
that we ourselves have been careful to improve all occasions
to compose these unhappy troubles, <i>yet we have
not, neither can we, admit of any mediation or interposing
betwixt the King and us by any foreign prince or state</i>.
And we desire that his Majesty, the French King, will
rest satisfied with this our resolution and answer.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> On
the committee which drew this reply was John Selden,
unsurpassed for learning and ability in the whole splendid
history of the English bar, in every book of whose
library was written, “Before everything, Liberty,” and
also that Harry Vane whom Milton, in one of his most
inspired sonnets, addresses as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The answer of such men is a precedent for us, especially
should England, taking up the rejected policy of Mazarin,
presumptuously send any ambassador to stay the
Republic in its war with Slavery.</p>

<p>The same heart of oak, so strenuous to repel intervention
of France between King and Parliament, was not
less strenuous the other way, when intervention could
serve the rights of England or the principles of religious
liberty. Such was England when ruled by the great
Protector, called in his own day “chief of men.” No
nation so powerful as to be exempt from that irresistible
intercession, where, beneath the garb of peace, was
a gleam of arms. From France, even under the rule of
Mazarin, he claimed respect for the Protestant name,
which he insisted upon making great and glorious.
From Spain, on whose extended empire the sun did
not cease to shine, he required that no Englishman
should be subject to the Inquisition. Reading to his
Council a despatch from Admiral Blake, announcing
justice obtained from the Viceroy of Malaga, Cromwell
said, that “he hoped to make the name of Englishman as
great as ever that of Roman had been.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> In this same
exalted mood he turned to propose mediation between
Protestant Sweden and Protestant Bremen, “chiefly
bewailing, that, being both his friends, they should so
despitefully combat one against another,” offering his
assistance to “a commodious accommodation on both
sides,” and exhorting them “by no means to refuse any
honest conditions of reconciliation.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Here was intervention
between nation and nation; but it was soon followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
by intervention in the internal affairs of a distant
country, which of all the acts of Cromwell is the most
touching and sublime. The French ambassador, while at
Whitehall, urging the signature of a treaty, was unexpectedly
interrupted by news from a secluded valley of
the Alps, far away among mountain torrents, affluents
of the Po, that a company of pious Protestants, for centuries
gathered there, keeping the truth pure, “when all
our fathers worshipped stocks and stones,” were suffering
terrible persecution from their sovereign, Emanuel
of Savoy. Despoiled of all possessions and liberties,
brutally driven from their homes, given over to licentious
and infuriate violence, and then turning in self-defence,
they had been “slain by the bloody Piemontese,
that rolled mother with infant down the rocks”; and it
was reported that French troops took part in the dismal
transaction. The Protector heard the story, and his pity
flashed into anger. He would not sign the treaty until
France united with him in securing justice to these
humble sufferers, whom he called the Lord’s people.
For their relief he contributed out of his own purse
two thousand pounds, and authorized a general collection
throughout England, which reached a large sum;
but besides money, he set apart a day of humiliation
and prayer for them. Nor was this all. “I should be
glad,” wrote his Secretary, Thurloe, “to have a most
particular account of that business, and to know what
is become of those poor people, for whom our very souls
here do bleed.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> But a pen mightier than that of any
plodding secretary was enlisted in this pious intervention.
It was John Milton, glowing with that indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
which his sonnet “On the Massacre in Piemont”
makes immortal in the heart of man, who wrote the
magnificent despatches, where the English nation of
that day, after declaring itself “linked together” with
its distant brethren, “not only by the same tie of humanity,
but by joint communion of the same religion,”
naturally and grandly insisted that “both this edict and
whatsoever may be decreed to their disturbance upon
the account of the Reformed Religion” should be abrogated,
“and that an end be put to their oppressions.”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
Not content with this call upon the Duke of Savoy,
the Protector appealed to Louis the Fourteenth and his
Cardinal Minister, to the States General of Holland, the
Protestant Cantons of Switzerland, the King of Denmark,
the King of Sweden, and even to the Protestant
Reformed Prince of remote Transylvania,&mdash;and always
by the pen of Milton,&mdash;rallying these princes and
powers in joint entreaty and intervention, and, if need
were, to “some other course to be speedily taken, that
such a numerous multitude of our innocent brethren
may not miserably perish for want of succor and assistance.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
The Regent of Savoy, daughter of Henry
the Fourth, professed to be affected by this English
charity, and announced for her Protestant subjects a
free pardon, and also “such privileges and graces as
could not but give the Lord Protector a sufficient evidence
<i>how great a respect they bare both to his person and
mediation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> But there was still delay. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Cromwell began to inquire where in the Prince’s territories
English troops might debark, and Mazarin, anxious
to complete the yet unfinished treaty, joined in
requiring immediate pacification of the Valleys and the
restoration of these persecuted people to their ancient
liberties. It was done. Such is the grandest intervention
of English history, inspired by Milton, enforced by
Cromwell, and sustained by Louis the Fourteenth with
his Cardinal Minister by his side, while foreign nations
watched the scene.</p>

<p>This great instance, constituting an inseparable part
of the Protector’s glory, is not the last where England
intervened for Protestant liberties. Troubles, beginning
in France with the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
broke forth in the rebellion of the Camisards, smarting
under the Revocation. Sheltered by the mountains of
the Cevennes, and nerved by a good cause, with the device
“Liberty of Conscience” on their standards, they
made head against two successive marshals of France,
and perplexed the old age of Louis the Fourteenth,
whose arms were already enfeebled by foreign war. At
last, through the mediation of England, the great monarch
made terms with his Protestant rebels, and this
civil war was brought to a close.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Intervention, more often armed than unarmed, showed
itself in the middle of the last century. All decency
was set aside, when Frederick of Prussia, Catharine of
Russia, and Maria Theresa of Austria invaded and partitioned
Poland, under pretext of suppressing anarchy.
Here was intervention with a vengeance, and on the
side of arbitrary power. Such is human inconsistency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
almost at the same time was another intervention in
the opposite direction. It was the armed intervention
of France, followed by that of Spain and Holland, in
behalf of American Independence. Spain began by
offer of mediation with a truce, which was accepted
by France on condition that meanwhile the United
States should be independent <i>in fact</i>.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Then came, in
1788, the armed intervention of Prussia to sustain the
Orange faction in Holland, followed soon by the compact
between Great Britain, Prussia, and Holland, known
as the Triple Alliance, which entered upon the business
of its copartnership by armed intervention to reconcile
the insurgent provinces of Belgium with the German
Emperor and their ancient Constitution. As France
began to shake with domestic troubles, mediation in
her affairs was proposed. Among the papers of Burke,
in 1791, is the draught of a memorial, in the name of
the British Government, offering what he calls “this
healing mediation.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> Then came the vast coalition for
armed intervention in France to put down the Republic.
This dreary cloud was for a moment brightened
by a British attempt in Parliament, through successive
debates, to institute an intercession for Lafayette, immured
in the dungeons of European despotism. “It
is reported,” said one of the orators, “that America has
solicited the liberation of her unfortunate adopted fellow-citizen.…
Let British magnanimity be called to
the aid of American gratitude, and exhibit to mankind
a noble proof, that, wherever the principles of genuine
liberty prevail, <i>they never fail to inspire sentiments of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
generosity, feelings of humanity, and a detestation of oppression</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile France, against whom all Europe intervened,
played her part of intervention, and the scene
was Switzerland. In the unhappy disputes between the
aristocratic and democratic parties by which this Republic
was distracted, French mediation became chronic, beginning
in 1738, when it found partial apology in the
invitation of several cantons and of Geneva; occurring
again in 1768, and again in 1782. The mountain Republic,
breathing the air of Freedom, was naturally moved
by the convulsions of the French Revolution. Civil war
ensued, and grew in bitterness. At last, when France
herself was composed under the powerful arm of the
First Consul, we find him turning to compose Swiss
troubles. He was a military ruler, and always acted
under the instincts of military power. By proclamation,
dated at the palace of St. Cloud, September 30,
1802, Bonaparte declared that for three years the Swiss
had been slaying each other, and that, if left to themselves,
they would continue to slay each other for three
years more, without reaching any understanding; that,
at first, he had resolved not to interfere, but that he
now changed his mind, and announced himself as mediator
of their difficulties, proclaiming confidently that
his mediation would be efficacious, as became the great
people in whose name he spoke. Deputies from the
cantons, together with the chief citizens, were summoned
to declare the means of restoring the Union, securing
peace, and reconciling all parties.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This was armed mediation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
but Switzerland was weak and France strong,
while the declared object was union, peace, and reconciliation.
I know not if all this ensued, but the civil
war was stifled, and the Constitution was established
by what is entitled in history the Act of Mediation.</p>

<p>From that period down to the present moment, intervention
in the internal affairs of other nations has been
a prevailing practice, now cautiously and peaceably, now
offensively and forcibly. Sometimes it was against the
rights of men, sometimes it was in their favor. Sometimes
England and France stood aloof, sometimes they
took part. The Congress of Vienna, which undertook
to settle the map of Europe, organized universal and
perpetual intervention in the interest of monarchical
institutions and existing dynasties. This compact was
renewed at the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1818,
with the explanatory declaration, that the five great
powers would never assume jurisdiction over questions
concerning the rights and interests of another power,
<i>except at its request</i>, and without inviting such power to
take part in the conference,&mdash;a concession obviously
adverse to any liberal movement. Meanwhile appeared
the Holy Alliance, specially to watch and control the
revolutionary tendencies of the age; but into this combination
England most honorably declined to enter.
The other powers were sufficiently active. Austria,
Russia, and Prussia did not hesitate at the Congress
of Laybach, in 1821, to institute armed intervention
for the suppression of liberal principles in Naples; and
again, two years later, at the Congress of Verona, these
same powers, together with France, instituted another
armed intervention to suppress liberal principles in
Spain, which ultimately led to the invasion of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
kingdom and the overthrow of its Constitution. France
was the belligerent agent, and would not be turned
aside, although the Duke of Wellington at Verona, and
Mr. Canning at home, sought to arrest her armies by
the mediation of Great Britain, which was directly
sought by Spain and directly refused by France. The
British Government, in admirable letters, composed
with unsurpassed skill, and constituting a noble page
of International Law, “disclaimed for itself, and denied
for other powers, the right of requiring any changes in
the internal institutions of independent states, <i>with the
menace of hostile attack in case of refusal</i>”; and bravely
declared to the imperial and royal interventionists, that,
“so long as the struggles and disturbances of Spain
should be confined within the circle of her own territory,
they could not be admitted by the British Government
to afford any plea of foreign interference”; and in
still another note repeated that a “<i>menace of direct and
imminent danger could alone, in exception to the general
rule, justify foreign interference</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> These were the words
of Mr. Canning; but even Lord Castlereagh, in an earlier
note, asserted the same limitation, which, at a later
day, had the unqualified support of Lord Grey, and also
of Lord Aberdeen. Justly interpreted, they leave no
apology for armed intervention, except in case of direct
and imminent danger, when a nation, like an individual,
may be thrown upon the great right of self-defence.</p>

<p>Great Britain bore testimony by what she did, as well
as by what she refused to do. Even while resisting the
armed intervention of the great conspiracy, her Government
intervened sometimes by mediation and sometimes
by arms. Early in the contest between Spain and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
colonies she consented to act as mediator, on the invitation
of the former, in hope of effecting reconciliation;
but Spain declined the mediation she had invited.
From 1812 to 1823, Great Britain constantly repeated
her offer. In the case of Portugal she went further.
Under the counsels of Mr. Canning, whose speech on
the occasion was of the most memorable character, she
intervened by landing troops at Lisbon; but this intervention
was vindicated by the obligations of treaty.
Next came the greater instance of Greece, when the
Christian powers of Europe intervened to arrest a protracted
struggle and to save this classic land from Turkish
tyranny. Here the first step was <i>a pressing invitation
from the Greeks</i> to the British and French Governments
for their mediation with the Ottoman Porte.
These powers united with Russia in proffering the
much desired intervention, which the Greeks at once
accepted and the Turks rejected. Already battle raged
fiercely, reddened by barbarous massacre. Without delay,
the allied forces were directed to compel the cessation
of hostilities, which was accomplished by the
destruction of the Turkish fleet at Navarino and the
occupation of the Morea by French troops. At last,
under the continued mediation of these powers, the independence
of Greece was recognized by the Ottoman
Porte, and another commonwealth consecrated to Freedom
took its place in the Family of Nations. But
mediation in Turkish affairs did not stop. The example
of Greece was followed by Egypt, whose provincial
chief, Mehemet Ali, rebelled, and by genius for war succeeded
in dispossessing the Ottoman Porte not only of
Egypt, but of other possessions also. This civil war
was first arrested by temporary arrangement at Kutaieh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
in 1833, under the mediation of Great Britain and
France, and finally ended by an armed mediation in
1840, when, after elaborate and irritating discussions
threatening to involve Europe, a treaty was concluded
at London between Great Britain, Russia, Austria, and
Prussia, by which the Pacha was compelled to relinquish
his conquests, while he was secured in the Government
of Egypt as perpetual vassal of the Porte. France, dissatisfied
with the terms of this adjustment, stood aloof
from the treaty, which found apology, such as it had,
first, in the invitation of the Sultan, and, secondly, in
the desire to preserve the integrity of the Turkish Empire,
as essential to the balance of power and the peace
of Europe, to which may also be added the desire to
stop effusion of blood.</p>

<p>Before the Eastern questions were settled, other complications
commenced in Western Europe. Belgium,
restless from the French Revolution of 1830, rose against
the House of Orange and claimed independence. Civil
war ensued; but the great powers promptly intervened,
even to the extent of arresting a Dutch army on its
march. Beginning with armistice, there was a long and
fine-spun negotiation, which, assuming the guise alternately
of pacific mediation and of armed intervention,
ended in the established separation of Belgium from
Holland, and its recognition as an independent nation.
Do you ask why Great Britain intervened on this occasion?
Lord John Russell, in the course of debate at a
subsequent day, declared that a special motive was “the
establishment of a free constitution.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Meanwhile the
Peninsula of Spain and Portugal was torn by civil war.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
The regents of these two kingdoms respectively appealed
to Great Britain and France for aid, especially in the
expulsion of the pretender Don Carlos from Spain and
the pretender Dom Miguel from Portugal. For this
purpose the Quadruple Alliance was formed in 1834.
The moral support from this treaty is said to have been
important, but Great Britain was compelled to provide
troops. This intervention, however, was <i>at the solicitation
of the actual Governments</i>. Even after Spanish
troubles were settled, war still lingered in the sister
kingdom, when, in 1847, the Queen addressed herself
to her allies, among whom was Great Britain, the ancient
patron of Portugal, who undertook to mediate
between her and her insurgent subjects, in the declared
hope of composing the difficulties “in a just and permanent
manner, with all due regard to the dignity of
the crown on the one hand, and to the constitutional
liberties of the nation on the other.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> The insurgents
did not submit until after military demonstrations. Liberty
and Peace were the two watchwords.</p>

<p>Then occurred the European uprising of 1848, with
France once more a Republic; but Europe, wiser grown,
did not interfere even so much as to write a letter. The
case was different with Hungary, whose victorious armies,
radiant with Liberty regained, expelled the Austrian
power only to be arrested by the armed intervention
of the Russian Czar, who yielded to the double pressure
of invitation from Austria and fear that successful
insurrection might extend into Poland. It was left
for France, in another country, with strange inconsistency,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
to play the part which Russia played in Hungary.
Rome, after rising against the temporal power of the
Pope and proclaiming the Republic, was occupied by a
French army, which expelled the republican magistrates,
and, though fourteen years are already passed since that
unhappy act, the occupation still continues. From this
military intervention Great Britain stands aloof. In a
despatch, dated at London, January 28, 1849, Lord Palmerston
makes a permanent record, to the honor of his
country, as follows: “Her Majesty’s Government would,
upon every account, and not only upon abstract principle,
but with reference to the general interests of Europe,
and from the value which they attach to the maintenance
of peace, <i>sincerely deprecate any attempt to settle
the differences between the Pope and his subjects by the
military interference of foreign powers</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This statesman
gives further point to the position of Great Britain
in contrast with France, when he says: “Armed intervention
<i>to assist in retaining a bad Government would
be unjustifiable</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Such was the declaration of the Lord
Palmerston of that day. How much more unjustifiable
the strange assistance now proposed <i>to found</i> a bad
Government! The British minister insisted that the
differences should be accommodated by “the diplomatic
interposition of friendly powers,” which he declared a
“much better mode of settlement than an authoritative
imposition of terms by the force of foreign arms.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
In harmony with this policy, Great Britain, during the
same year, united with France in proffering mediation
between the insurgent Sicilians and the King of Naples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the notorious Bomba, in the hope of helping good government
and liberal principles. Not disheartened by
rebuff, these two powers, in 1856, united in friendly
remonstrance to the same tyrannical sovereign against
the harsh system of political arrests, and against his
cruelty to good citizens thrust without trial into the
worst of prisons. The advice was indignantly rejected,
and the two powers that gave it withdrew their ministers
from Naples. The sympathy of Russia was on the
wrong side, and Prince Gortschakoff, in a circular, while
admitting, that, “as a consequence of friendly fore-thought,
one Government might give advice to another,”
declared, that “to endeavor by threats or a
menacing demonstration to obtain from the King of
Naples concessions in the internal affairs of his Government
is a violent usurpation of his authority, and
an open declaration of the right of the strong over the
weak.”<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This was practically answered by Lord Clarendon,
speaking for Great Britain at the Congress of
Paris, when, admitting the principle that no Government
has the right to interfere in the internal affairs
of other states, he declares that there are cases where
an exception to this rule becomes equally a right and
a duty; that peace must not be broken, but that there
is no peace without justice; and that therefore the Congress
must let the King of Naples know its desire for
the amelioration of his Government, and must demand
amnesty for political offenders suffering without trial.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
This language was bold beyond the practice of diplomacy,
but the intervention it proposed was on the side
of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>I must draw this chapter to a close, although the long
list is not yet exhausted. Even while I speak, we hear
of intervention by England and France in the civil war
between the Emperor of China and his subjects,&mdash;and
also in that other war between the Emperor of Russia
on the one side and the Poles whom he claims as subjects
on the other, but with this difference, that in
China these powers take the part of the existing Government,
while in Poland they intervene against the
existing Government. In the face of positive declarations
of neutrality, the British and French admirals
have united their forces with the Chinese; but thus
far in Poland, although there is no declaration of neutrality,
the intervention is unarmed. In both these
instances we witness a common tendency, directed, it
may be, by the interests or prejudices of the time, and,
so far as it has proceeded, it is, at least in Poland, on the
side of liberal institutions. But, alas for human consistency!
the French Emperor is now intervening in
Mexico with armies and navies to build an imperial
throne for an Austrian Archduke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is one long-continued British intervention, which
speaks now with controlling power; and it is on this
account that I reserve it for the close of what I have to
say on this head. Though not without original shades
of dark, it has for more than half a century been a shining
example to the civilized world. I refer to that <i>intervention
against Slavery</i>, which, from its first adoption, has
been so constant and brilliant as to make us forget the
earlier <i>intervention in behalf of Slavery</i>, when, for instance,
at the Peace of Utrecht, Great Britain intervened to
extort the detestable privilege of supplying slaves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Spanish America at the rate of four thousand eight hundred
yearly during the space of thirty years, and then
again, at the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, higgled for a yet
longer sanction of the ignoble intervention; nay, it almost
makes us forget the kindred intervention, at once
sordid and criminal, by which this power counteracted
all efforts for the prohibition of the slave-trade even in
its own colonies, and thus helped to fasten Slavery upon
Virginia and Carolina. The abolition of the slave-trade
by Act of Parliament, in 1807, was the signal for a
change of history. A British poet at the time gave
exulting expression to the grandeur of the epoch:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“‘Thy chains are broken, Africa, be free!’</div>
<div class="verse">Thus saith the island-empress of the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">Thus saith Britannia. O ye winds and waves,</div>
<div class="verse">Waft the glad tidings to the land of slaves!”<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Curiously, it was the other color which gained the
first fruits of this revolution, by triumphant intervention
for the overthrow of White Slavery in the Barbary
States. The old hero of Acre, Sir Sidney Smith,
released from long imprisonment in France, sought to
organize a “holy league” for this purpose; the subject
was discussed at the Congress of Vienna; and the
agents of Spain and Portugal, anxious for the punishment
of their piratical neighbors, argued, that, because
Great Britain had abolished for itself the traffic in African
slaves, therefore it must see that whites were no
longer enslaved in the Barbary States. The argument
was less logical than humane. But Great Britain undertook
the work. With a fleet complete at all points,
consisting of five line-of-battle ships, five frigates, four
bomb-vessels, and five gun-brigs, Lord Exmouth approached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Algiers, where he was joined by a considerable
Dutch fleet, anxious to take part. “If force must
be resorted to,” said the Admiral in general orders shortly
before, “we have the consolation of knowing that we
fight in the sacred cause of Humanity, and cannot fail
of success.” Less than half a day was enough, with
such a force in such a cause. The formidable castles of
the great Slavemonger were battered to pieces, and he
was compelled to sign a treaty, confirmed under a salute
of twenty-one guns, which in its first article stipulated
“the abolition of Christian Slavery forever.” Glorious
and beneficent intervention! Not inferior to that renowned
instance of Antiquity, where the Carthaginians
were required to abolish the practice of sacrificing their
own children,&mdash;a treaty which has been called the noblest
of history, because stipulated in favor of human
nature. The Admiral who had thus triumphed was
hailed as Emancipator. He received a new rank in the
peerage, and a new blazonry on his coat of arms. The
rank is continued in his family, and on their shield,
in perpetual memory of this great transaction, is still
borne <i>a Christian slave holding aloft the Cross and dropping
his broken fetters</i>. But the personal satisfactions of
the Admiral were more than rank or heraldry. In his
despatch to the Government, describing the battle, and
written at the time, he says: “To have been one of the
humble instruments in the hands of Divine Providence
for bringing to reason a ferocious Government and
destroying forever the insufferable and horrid system
of Christian Slavery, can never cease to be a source of
delight and heartfelt comfort to every individual happy
enough to be employed in it.”<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>I have said too much with regard to an instance,
which, though beautiful and important, is only a parenthesis
in the grander and more extensive intervention
against African Slavery, which was already organizing,
destined at last to embrace the whole human family.
Even before Wilberforce triumphed in Parliament, Great
Britain intervened with Napoleon, in 1806, pressing
him to join in the abolition of the slave-trade; but
he flatly refused. What France would not then yield
was exacted from Portugal in 1810, from Sweden in
1813, and from Denmark in 1814. An ineffectual attempt
was made to enlist Spain, even by temptation of
pecuniary subsidies,&mdash;and an appeal was made to the
restored monarch of France, Louis the Eighteenth, with
the offer of a sum of money outright or the cession of
a West India island, in consideration of the desired abolition.
The Prince Regent wrote with his own hand to
the latter, assuring him that he could not give a more
acceptable proof of his regard than by consenting to the
abolition. Had gratitude to a benefactor prevailed, these
powers could not have resisted; but Lord Castlereagh
confessed in the House of Commons, that in France there
was distrust of the British Government “even among
the better classes of people,” who thought that its zeal
in this behalf was prompted by desire to injure the
French colonies and commerce, rather than by benevolence.
The British minister was more successful with
Portugal, where pecuniary equivalents led to a supplementary
treaty, in January, 1815. This was followed by
the declaration of the Congress of Vienna, on motion
of Lord Castlereagh, 8th February, 1815, denouncing
the African slave-trade “as repugnant to the principles
of humanity and of universal morality.” Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
Napoleon returned from Elba, and what British
intervention failed to accomplish with the Bourbon
monarch, and the Emperor once flatly refused, was
now spontaneously done by him, doubtless in the hope
of conciliating British sentiment. His hundred days of
power were signalized by an ordinance abolishing the
slave-trade in France and her colonies. Louis the Eighteenth,
once again restored by British arms, and with
the shadow of Waterloo resting upon France, could not
do less than ratify the imperial ordinance by a royal assurance
that “the traffic was henceforth forever forbidden
to all the subjects of his most Christian Majesty.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
Holland came under the same influence, and accepted
the restitution of her colonies, except the Cape of Good
Hope and Guiana, on condition of the entire abolition
of the slave-trade in the restored colonies, and also
everywhere else beneath her flag. Spain was the most
indocile; but this proud monarchy, under whose auspices
the African slave-trade first came into being, at last
yielded. By the treaty of Madrid, of 23d September,
1817, extorted by Great Britain, it stipulated the immediate
abolition of the trade north of the equator, and
also, after 1820, its abolition everywhere, in consideration
of four hundred thousand pounds, the price of Freedom,
paid by the other contracting party. In vindication
of this intervention, Wilberforce declared in Parliament,
that “the grant to Spain would be more than
repaid to Great Britain in commercial advantages by
the opening of a great continent to British industry,”&mdash;all
of which was impossible, if the slave-trade was
allowed to continue under the Spanish flag.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1818, and of
Verona, in 1822, Great Britain continued her intervention
against Slavery. Chateaubriand, in his history of
the latter Congress, pauses to express his admiration
of the “singular perseverance” in this cause manifested
by her at all Congresses, amidst questions the most
urgent and interests the most pressing.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Here her
primacy was undisputed, and her fame complete. It
was the common remark of Continental publicists, that
she “made the cause her own.”<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> One of them portrays
her vividly, since 1810 waging “relentless war”
against the principle of the slave-trade, and by this
“crusade,” undertaken in the name of Humanity, making
herself the “declared protectress” of the African
race. These are the words of a French authority.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> According
to him, it is nothing less than “relentless war”
and a “crusade” which she has waged, and the position
which she has achieved is that of “protectress” of the
African race,&mdash;while no less a person than Chateaubriand
recognizes with admiration the “singular perseverance”
she has displayed in this practical extension
of Christianity. Not content with imposing her magnanimous
system upon the civilized world, she carried
it among the tribes and chiefs of Africa, who, by her
omnipresent intervention, were summoned to renounce
a barbarous and criminal custom. By a Parliamentary
Report, it appears that in 1849 there were twenty-four
treaties in force between Great Britain and foreign civilized
powers for the suppression of the slave-trade, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
also forty-two similar treaties between Great Britain
and native chiefs of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>This intervention was not by treaties only; it was by
correspondence and circulars also. And here I approach
a part of the subject which illustrates the vivacity of
its character. All British ministers and consuls were
so many pickets on constant guard in the outposts.
They were held to every service by which the cause
could be promoted, even to translating and printing
documents against the slave-trade, especially in countries
where, unhappily, it was still pursued. There was
the Pope’s Bull of 1839, which Lord Palmerston transmitted
for this purpose to his agents in Cuba, Brazil,
and even in Turkey, some of whom were unsuccessful
in their efforts to obtain its publication, although, curiously
enough, it was published in Turkey.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Such zeal could not stop at the abolition of the traffic.
Accordingly, Great Britain, by Act of Parliament, in
1834, enfranchised all the slaves in her own possessions,
and thus again secured to herself the primacy of a lofty
cause. The intervention was now openly declared to be
against Slavery itself, assuming its most positive character
while Lord Palmerston was Foreign Secretary,&mdash;and
I say this sincerely to his great honor. Throughout
his long life, among all the various concerns in which
he has acted, there is nothing to be remembered hereafter
with such gratitude. By his untiring diplomacy
her Majesty’s Government constituted itself a vast Abolition
Society, with the whole world for its field. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
was in no respect behind the famous World’s Convention
against Slavery, held at London in June, 1840, with
Thomas Clarkson, the pioneer Abolitionist, as President;
for the strongest declarations of this Convention were
adopted by Lord Palmerston as “the sentiments of her
Majesty’s Government,” and communicated officially to
British functionaries in foreign lands. The Convention
declared “the utter injustice of Slavery in all its
forms, and the evil it inflicts upon its miserable victims,
and the necessity of employing every means,
moral, religious, and pacific, for its complete abolition,
an object most dear to the members of this Convention,
and for the consummation of which they are especially
assembled.”<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> These words became the words of
the British Government, and in circular letters were sent
over the world.</p>

<p>It was not enough to declare the true principles.
They must be enforced. Spain and Portugal hung
back. The Secretary of the Antislavery Society was
sent “to endeavor to create in those countries a public
feeling in favor of the abolition of Slavery”; and the
British minister at Lisbon was desired by Lord Palmerston
to “afford all the assistance and protection in his
power for promoting the object of his journey.”<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> British
functionaries abroad sometimes backslided. This
was corrected by circulars setting forth “that it would
be unfitting that any officer holding an appointment
under the British Crown should, either directly or indirectly,
hold or be interested in slave property.”<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> The
Parliamentary Papers which attest the universality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
this instruction show the completeness with which it
was executed. The consul at Rio Janeiro, in slaveholding
Brazil, had among his domestics three negro slaves,
two men and a woman; “of the men one was a groom
and the other a waiter, and the woman he was forced to
hire to nurse one of his children”; but he discharged
them at once, under the antislavery discipline of the
British Foreign Office, and Lord Palmerston, in formal
despatch, “expresses his satisfaction.”<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> In Cuba, at the
time of its reception, there was not a single resident
officer, holding under the British Crown, “who was
entirely free from the charge of countenancing Slavery.”
But only a few weeks afterwards it was officially
reported from Havana that there was “not a
single British officer residing within the consular jurisdiction
who had not relinquished, or was not at least
preparing to relinquish, this odious practice.”<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> This
was quick work. The metamorphosis was prompt as
anything in ancient fable. Every person holding office
under the British Government at once set his face
against Slavery, <i>and the way was by having nothing
to do with it, even in employing or hiring the slave of
another,&mdash;nothing, “directly or indirectly”</i>.</p>

<p>Lord Palmerston, acting in the name of the British
Government, did not stop with changing British officials
into practical Abolitionists, whenever they were in foreign
countries. He sought to enlist other European
Governments, and to this end requested them to forbid
their functionaries residing in slaveholding communities
to be interested in slave property or in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
holding or hiring of slaves. Denmark for a moment
hesitated, from unwillingness to debar them from acting
according to the laws where they resided, when the
minister at once cited in support of his request the example
of Belgium, Hanover, Holland, Sweden, Naples,
Portugal, and Sardinia, all without delay having yielded
to this British intervention, and Denmark ranged herself
in the list.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Nor was this indefatigable Propaganda confined
to the Christian powers. With a sacred pertinacity
it reached into distant Mohammedan regions, where
Slavery was imbedded not only in the laws, but the
habits, the social system, and the very life of the people,
and called upon the Government to act against it. No
impediment deterred,&mdash;no prejudice, national or religious.
To the Shah of Persia, ruling a vast, outlying
slave empire, Lord Palmerston announced the desire
of the British Government “to see the slave-trade put
down and the condition of Slavery abolished in every
part of the world”; “that it conceived much good
might be accomplished in these respects, even in Mohammedan
countries, by steady perseverance, and by
never omitting to take advantage of favorable opportunities”;
and “that the Shah would be doing a thing
extremely acceptable to the British Government and
nation, if he would issue a decree prohibiting for the
future the importation of slaves of any kind into Persia,
and making it penal for a Persian to purchase slaves.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
To the Sultan of Turkey, whose mother was a slave,
whose wives were all slaves, and whose very counsellors,
generals, and admirals were originally slaves, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
made a similar appeal, and he sought to win the dependent
despot by reminding him that only in this way
could he hope for that good-will which was so essential
to his Government; “that the continued support of
Great Britain will, for some years to come, be an object
of importance to the Porte,&mdash;<i>that this support cannot
be given effectually, unless the sentiments and opinions of
the majority of the British nation shall be favorable to the
Turkish Government,&mdash;and that the whole of the British
nation unanimously desire, beyond almost anything else, to
put an end to the cruel practice of making slaves</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Such,
at that time, was the voice of the British people. Since
Cromwell pleaded for the Vaudois, no nobler voice had
gone forth. The World’s Convention against Slavery
saw itself transfigured, while platform speeches were
transfused into diplomatic notes. The Convention, earnest
for Universal Emancipation, declared that “<i>the
friendly interposition</i> of Great Britain could be employed
for no nobler purpose,” and, as if to crown its work, in
an address to Lord Palmerston, humbly and earnestly
implored his Lordship to use his high authority for “connecting
the overthrow of Slavery with the consolidation
of Peace”; and these words were at once adopted in
foreign despatches, as expressing the sentiments of her
Majesty’s Government.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> Better watchwords could not
be, nor any more worthy of the British name. <i>There
can be no consolidation of Peace without the overthrow
of Slavery.</i> This is as true now as when first uttered.
Therefore is Great Britain still bound to her original
faith; nor can she abandon the cause, of which she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the declared protectress, without betrayal of Peace, as
well as betrayal of Liberty.</p>

<p>Even now while I speak this same conspicuous fidelity
to a sacred cause is announced. The ship canal
across the Isthmus of Suez, first attempted by the early
Pharaohs, and at last resumed by French influence, under
the auspices of the Pacha, is most zealously opposed
by Great Britain for the declared reason that in its construction
“forced labor” is employed, which this power
cannot in conscience sanction. Not even to complete
this vast beneficence, bringing East and West near together,
for which mankind has waited throughout long
centuries, will Great Britain depart from the rule so
gloriously declared. Slavery is wrong, therefore not
to be employed. The canal must stop, if it cannot be
constructed without “forced labor.”</p>

<p>The veteran statesman who did so much in this cause,
weaving its golden thread into the tissue of his renown,
dwelt on it with pride, and accepted for his country the
primacy that had been awarded. Never, in his extended
Parliamentary career, did Lord Palmerston rise to a
higher mood,&mdash;not even when claiming for Englishmen
all the immunities of Roman citizenship,&mdash;<i>Civis Romanus
sum</i>,&mdash;than when he pictured the dependence
of Africans on their constant friend. “If ever,” said
he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> “by the assault of overpowering enemies, or by the
errors of her misguided sons, England should fall, and
her star should lose its lustre, with her fall, for a long
period of time, would the hopes of the African, whether
in his own continent or in the vast regions of America,
be buried in the darkness of despair. I know well that
in such case Providence would in due course of time
raise up some other nation to inherit our principles and
to imitate our practice; but, taking the world as it is,
and states as they are constituted, I do not know&mdash;and
I say it with regret and with pain&mdash;I do not know
any nation that is now ready in this respect to supply
our place.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And can it be that now, instead of the African,
a rebellion inspired by Slavery turns to England
with hope?</p>

<p>The honorable story of British intervention against
Slavery is incomplete without showing how its generous
ardor broke forth against our Republic, which was denounced
as linked with Slavery. Literature, eloquence,
and poetry lent themselves to expose the terrible inconsistency.
Lord Russell stepped aside from the easy
path of biography, to declare that among us “oxen and
horses are better treated than the men and women of
African blood,” and then to proclaim “the cry of outraged
humanity,” “the current of human sympathy,”
and “the decrees of Eternal Justice,” irresistible.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Lord
Macaulay, in the House of Commons, thundered forth:
“The Government of the United States has formally
declared itself the patron, the champion, of Negro Slavery
all over the world, the evil genius, the Arimanes, of
the African race, and seems to take pride in this shameful
and odious distinction.… They put themselves
at the head of the slave-driving interest throughout the
world, just as Elizabeth put herself at the head of the
Protestant interest; and wherever their favorite institution
is in danger, are ready to stand by it as Elizabeth
stood by the Dutch.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Thomas Campbell, fresh from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
writing “Ye Mariners of England” and “Hohenlinden,”
struck at our Slavery in most scornful verses on the
national flag:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“But what’s the meaning of the stripes?</div>
<div class="verse">They mean your negroes’ scars!”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">If these things, so bitterly said, were true, if Campbell,
Macaulay, and Russell were right in their indignant rebuke,
if Palmerston was justified in his eloquent pride,
then must England make haste to turn away from a
rebellion which seeks to reverse that noble intervention
where the liberty of the African was a constant
guide.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I close the historic instances illustrating the
right and practice of foreign intervention. The whole
subject is seen in these instances, teaching clearly what
to avoid and what to follow. In this way, the Law of
Nations, like History, gives its best lessons. For the
sake of plainness, I gather up some of the conclusions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Foreign intervention is <i>armed</i> or <i>unarmed</i>, although
sometimes the two are not easily distinguishable. Unarmed
intervention may have in it the menace of arms,
or it may be war in disguise. When this is the case, it
must be treated accordingly.</p>

<p><i>Armed</i> intervention is war, and nothing less. Of
course it can be vindicated only as war, and it must
be resisted as war. Believing, as I do most profoundly,
that war can never be a game, but must always be a
crime when it ceases to be a duty,&mdash;a crime to be
shunned, if not a duty to be performed swiftly and
surely,&mdash;and that a nation, like an individual, is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
permitted to take the sword except in just self-defence,&mdash;I
find the same limitation in armed intervention,
which becomes unjust invasion in proportion as it departs
from just self-defence. Under this head is naturally
included all that intervention moved by a tyrannical
or intermeddling spirit, because such intervention,
whatever its professions, is essentially hostile,&mdash;as
when Russia, Prussia, and Austria partitioned Poland,
when the Holy Alliance intermeddled everywhere and
menaced even America, or when Russia intervened to
crush the independence of Hungary, or France to crush
the Roman Republic. All such intervention is inexcusable,
illegal, and scandalous. Its vindication is found
only in the effrontery that might makes right.</p>

<p><i>Unarmed</i> intervention is of a different nature. If
sincerely unarmed, it may be regarded as obtrusive, but
not hostile. It may assume the form of mediation or the
proffer of good offices, at the invitation of both parties,
or, in the case of civil war, at the invitation of the original
authority. With such invitation, this intervention
is proper and honorable; without such invitation, it is
of doubtful character; but if known to be contrary to
the desires of both parties, or to the desires of the original
authority in a distracted country, it becomes offensive
and inadmissible, <i>unless obviously on the side of
Human Rights</i>, when the act of intervention takes its
character from the cause in which it is made. But
it must not be forgotten, that, in the case of civil war,
any mediation, or, indeed, any proposition not enjoining
submission to the original authority, is in its nature adverse,
for it assumes the separate existence of the other
party, and secures for it temporary immunity and opportunity,
if not independence. Congress, therefore, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
right in declaring to foreign powers that any renewed
effort of mediation in our affairs will be regarded as an
unfriendly act.</p>

<p>There is another case of unarmed intervention which
I cannot criticize. It is where a nation intercedes or
interposes in favor of Human Rights, or to secure the
overthrow of some enormous wrong,&mdash;as when Cromwell
pleaded, with noble intercession, for the secluded
Protestants of the Alpine valleys, when Great Britain
and France declared sympathy with the Greeks struggling
for independence, and when Great Britain alone,
by splendid diplomacy, set herself against Slavery everywhere
throughout the world.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The full lesson may be summed up briefly. All intervention
in the internal affairs of another nation is
contrary to law and reason, and can be vindicated only
by overruling necessity. Intervening by war, then must
there be the necessity of self-defence. Intervening by
mediation or intercession, then must you be able to
speak in behalf of civilization endangered or human
nature wronged. To this humane policy no power is
bound so absolutely as England; especially is none so
fixed, beyond possibility of retreat or change, in hostility
to Slavery, whatever shape this criminal pretension
may assume, whether the animating principle of a nation,
the “forced labor” of a multitude, or even the
service of a solitary domestic.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>There is a species of foreign intervention which
stands by itself and has its own illustrations. Therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
I speak of it by itself. It is where a foreign power
undertakes to acknowledge the independence of a colony
or province renouncing its original allegiance, and
it may be compendiously called <i>Intervention by Recognition</i>.
Recognition is strictly applicable only to the
act of the original government, renouncing all claim of
allegiance, and at last acknowledging the independence
in dispute. It becomes an act of intervention, where a
foreign government steps between the two parties. The
original government is so far master of its position, that
it may select its own time in making this recognition.
But the question arises, At what time and under what
circumstances can this recognition be made by a foreign
power? It is obvious that a recognition proper at
one time and under special circumstances would not
be proper at another time and under different circumstances.
Mr. Canning said, with reference to Spanish
America, that, “if he piqued himself upon anything, it
was upon the subject of <i>time</i>”; and he added, that there
were two ways of proceeding,&mdash;“recklessly and with
a hurried course to the object, which might be soon
reached and almost as soon lost, or by another course
so strictly guarded that no principle was violated and
no strict offence given to other powers.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> These are
words of wise statesmanship, and they present the practical
question occurring in every case of recognition:
What condition of the controversy will justify such
intervention?</p>

<p>Here again the whole matter is best explained by
historic instances. The earliest is that of Switzerland,
as long ago as 1307, breaking off from the House of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Hapsburg, whose original cradle was a Swiss canton.
But Austria did not acknowledge the independence of
the Republic until the Peace of Westphalia, nearly
three centuries and a half after the struggle began under
William Tell. Meanwhile the cantons lived through
the vicissitudes of war, foreign and domestic, and formed
treaties with other powers, including the Pope. Before
Swiss independence was acknowledged, the Dutch conflict
began under William of Orange. Smarting from
intolerable grievances, and with a price set upon the
head of their illustrious Stadtholder, the United Provinces
of the Netherlands, in 1581, renounced the tyrannical
sovereignty of Philip the Second, and declared
themselves independent. In the history of Freedom
this is an important epoch. They were Protestants, battling
for rights denied, and Queen Elizabeth of England,
the head of Protestantism, acknowledged their independence,
and shortly afterwards extended military aid.
Nor did other powers stand aloof. In 1594, Scotland,
Protestant also, under James the Sixth, afterwards the
first James of England, treated with the insurgent
Provinces as successors of the Houses of Burgundy
and Austria, and in 1596 France entered into alliance
with them. The contest continued, sustained on the
side of Spain by the genius of Parma and Spinola, and
on the side of the infant Republic by the youthful talent
of Maurice, son of the great Stadtholder. But the
claims of Spain were enduring; for it was not until the
Peace of Westphalia, eighty years after the revolt, and
nearly seventy years after their Declaration of Independence,
that this power consented to Dutch independence.
Nor do these examples stand alone, even at that
early day. Portugal, unjustly subjugated by Spain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
1580, broke away in 1640 and declared herself independent,
under the Duke of Braganza as King. A year
scarcely passed before Charles the First of England
negotiated a treaty with the new sovereign. The contest
had ceased, but not the claim; for it was only
after twenty-eight years that Spain made this other
recognition.</p>

<p>Traversing the Atlantic Ocean in space and more than
a century in time, I come to the next historic instance,
so interesting to us all, while as a precedent it dominates
the whole question. The long discord between
the Colonies and the mother country broke forth in
blood on the 19th of April, 1775. Independence was
declared on the 4th of July, 1776. Battles ensued,&mdash;Trenton,
Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Saratoga,
followed by the winter of Valley Forge. The contest
was yet undecided, when, on the 6th of February, 1778,
France entered into a treaty of amity and commerce with
the United States, containing, among other things, a recognition
of their independence, with mutual stipulations
between the two parties to protect the commerce of the
other, by convoy on the ocean, “against all attacks, force,
and violence”;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and on the 13th of March this treaty
was communicated to the British Government by the
French ambassador at London, with a diplomatic note,
in which the United States are described as “in full
possession of the independence pronounced by their
Act of 4th July, 1776,” and the British Government
is warned that the King of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> “being determined
effectually to protect the legitimate freedom of the commerce
of his subjects and to maintain the honor of his
flag, has taken in consequence some eventual measures
with the United States of North America.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> A further
treaty of alliance, whose declared object was the maintenance
of the independence of the United States, had
been signed on the same day, but this was not communicated;
nor is there evidence that it was known to the
British Government at the time. The communication
of the other sufficed, for it was an open recognition
of the new power, with promise of protection on the
ocean, <i>while the war was yet flagrant between the two
parties</i>. As such it must be regarded as an armed
recognition, constituting in itself a belligerent act, aggravated
and explained by the circumstances under
which it was made, the warning, in the nature of menace,
by which it was accompanied, the clandestine preparations
by which it was preceded, and the corsairs to
cruise against British commerce, which for some time
had been allowed to swarm under the American flag
from French ports. It was so accepted by the British
Government. The British minister was summarily
withdrawn from Paris, all French vessels in British harbors
were seized, and on the 17th March a message from
the King was brought down to Parliament in the nature
of a declaration of war against France. In this declaration
there was no allusion to anything but the treaty
of amity and commerce officially communicated by the
French ambassador, which was denounced by his Majesty
as an “unprovoked and unjust aggression on the
honor of his crown and the essential interests of his
kingdoms, <i>contrary to the most solemn assurances, subversive
of the Law of Nations, and injurious to the rights of
every sovereign power in Europe</i>.” Only three days later,
on the 20th March, the Commissioners of the United<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
States were received by the King of France in solemn
audience, with all the pomp and ceremony accorded
by the Court of Versailles to the representatives of
sovereign powers. War ensued between France and
Great Britain on land and sea, in which Holland and
Spain afterwards took part against Great Britain. With
such allies, a just cause prevailed. Great Britain, by
provisional articles, signed at Paris 30th November,
1782, acknowledged the United States “to be free, sovereign,
and independent,” and declared the boundaries
thereof.</p>

<p>Colonial independence was contagious, and the contest
for it presented another illustration, more discussed,
and constituting a precedent, if possible, more
interesting still. This was when the Spanish colonies
in America, following the Northern example, broke
away from the mother country and declared themselves
independent. The contest began as early as 1810, but
it was long continued, and extended over an immense
region,&mdash;from New Mexico and California in
the North to Cape Horn in the South,&mdash;washed by
two vast oceans, traversed by mighty rivers, and buttressed
by lofty mountains fruitful in silver, capped
with snow, and shooting volcanic fire. At last the
United States, satisfied that the ancient power of Spain
had ceased to exist beyond reasonable chance of restoration,
and that the contest was practically ended,
acknowledged the independence of Mexico and five
other provinces. This act was approached only after
frequent debate in Congress, where Henry Clay took
an eminent part, and after most careful consideration
in the Cabinet, where John Quincy Adams, as Secretary
of State, shed upon the question all the light of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
his unsurpassed knowledge, derived from long practice
as well as from laborious study of International Law.
This judgment must be regarded as a sufficient authority.
President Monroe, in a special message, on the
8th of March, 1822, twelve years after the war began,
called the attention of Congress to the state of the
contest, which he said had “now reached such a stage,
and been attended with such decisive success on the
part of the provinces, that it merits the most profound
consideration whether their right to the rank of independent
nations, with all the advantages incident to
it in their intercourse with the United States, is not
complete.” After setting forth the <i>de facto</i> condition
of things, he proceeded: “Thus it is manifest that all
those provinces are not only in the full enjoyment of
their independence, but, <i>considering the state of the
war and other circumstances, that there is not the most
remote prospect of their being deprived of it</i>.” In proposing
their recognition, the President declared that
it was done “under a thorough conviction that it is
in strict accord with the Law of Nations”; and further,
that “it is not contemplated to change thereby, in
the slightest manner, our friendly relations with either
of the parties.” In accordance with this recommendation,
Congress authorized the recognition. Three years
later the same thing was done by Great Britain, after
much debate, diplomatic and Parliamentary. No case
of international duty has been illustrated by a clearer
eloquence, an ampler knowledge, or a purer wisdom.
The despatches were written by Mr. Canning, and upheld
by him in Parliament; but Lord Liverpool took
part in the discussion, succinctly declaring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> “that there
could be no right to recognition while the contest
was actually going on,”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>&mdash;a conclusion cautiously, but
strongly, enforced by Lord Lansdowne, and nobly vindicated,
in an oration reviewing the whole subject, by
that great publicist, Sir James Mackintosh. All inclined
to recognition, but admitted that it could not
take place <i>so long as the contest continued</i>,&mdash;and that
there must be “such a contest as exhibits some equality
of force, and of which, if the combatants were left to
themselves, the issue would be in some degree doubtful.”
The Spanish strength throughout the whole continent
was reduced to a single castle in Mexico, an island
on the coast of Chile, and a small army in Upper Peru,
while in Buenos Ayres no Spanish soldier had set foot
for fourteen years. “Is this a contest,” said Mackintosh,
“approaching to equality? Is it sufficient to render
the independence of such a country doubtful? Does
it deserve the name of a contest?”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> It was not until
1825 that Great Britain was so far satisfied as to acknowledge
this independence. France followed in 1830,
and Castilian pride relaxed in 1836, twenty-six years
from the first date of the contest.</p>

<p>The next instance is Greece, which declared independence
January 27, 1822. After a cruel contest of more
than five years, with alternate success and disaster, the
great powers intervened forcibly in 1827; but the final
recognition was postponed till May, 1832. Then came
the instance of Belgium, which declared independence
in November, 1830, and was promptly recognized by
the great powers intervening for this purpose. The last
instance is Texas, which declared independence in December,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
1835, and defeated the Mexican army under
Santa Aña, making him prisoner, in 1836. The power
of Mexico seemed to be overthrown; but Andrew Jackson,
then President of the United States, in his Message
of December 21, 1836, laid down the rule of caution
and justice, as follows: “The acknowledgment of a new
state as independent and entitled to a place in the Family
of Nations is at all times an act of great delicacy
and responsibility, but more especially so when such
state has forcibly separated itself from another, of which
it had formed an integral part, and which still claims
dominion over it. <i>A premature recognition</i> under these
circumstances, <i>if not looked upon as justifiable cause of
war</i>, is always liable to be regarded as a proof of an unfriendly
spirit.” And he concluded by proposing that
our country should “stand aloof” until the question
was decided “beyond cavil or dispute.” During the
next year, when the contest had practically ceased and
only the claim remained, this new power was acknowledged
by the United States, who were followed in 1839
by France, and in 1840 by Great Britain, Holland, and
Belgium. Texas was annexed to the United States in
1845; but at this time Mexico had not joined in the
general recognition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are historic instances illustrating Intervention
by Recognition. As in other cases of intervention, the
recognition may be <i>armed</i> or <i>unarmed</i>, with an intermediate
case, where the recognition may seem unarmed,
when in reality it is armed,&mdash;as when France simply
announced recognition of the independence of the United
States and at the same time prepared to maintain it
by war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Armed</i> recognition is simply <i>Recognition by Coercion</i>.
It is a belligerent act, constituting war, and can be
vindicated only as war. No nation will undertake it,
unless ready to assume all the responsibilities of war,&mdash;as
in the recent cases of Greece and Belgium, not
to mention the recognition of the United States by
France. But an attempt, under guise of recognition,
to coerce the dismemberment or partition of a country
is in its nature offensive beyond ordinary war, especially
when the country to be sacrificed is a republic,
and the plotters against it are crowned heads. Proceeding
from the consciousness of brute power, such an attempt
is an insult to mankind. If armed recognition
at any time can find apology, it is only <i>where sincerely
made for the protection of Human Rights</i>. It would be
hard to condemn that intervention which saved Greece
to Freedom.</p>

<p><i>Unarmed</i> recognition is where a foreign power acknowledges
in some pacific form the independence of a
colony or province against the claim of its original government.
Although excluding all idea of <i>coercion</i>, yet
it cannot be uniformly justified.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here we are brought to that question of “time,” on
which Mr. Canning so pointedly piqued himself, and
to which President Jackson referred, when he suggested
that “a premature recognition” might be “looked upon
as justifiable cause of war.” Nothing is more clear than
that recognition may be favored at one time, while it
must be rejected at another. So far as it assumes to
determine rights instead of facts, or to anticipate the
result of a contest, it is wrongful. No nation can undertake
to sit in judgment on the rights of another nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
without its consent. Therefore it cannot declare
that <i>de jure</i> a colony or province is <i>entitled</i> to independence,
but, from the necessity of the case, and that international
intercourse may not fail, it must ascertain
the facts, carefully and wisely, and, on the actual evidence,
it may declare that <i>de facto</i> the colony or province
appears <i>to be in possession</i> of independence,&mdash;which
means, first, that the original government is dispossessed
beyond the possibility of recovery, and, secondly, that
the new government has achieved a reasonable stability,
with fixed limits, giving assurance of solid power.
All this is simply fact and nothing more. But just in
proportion as a foreign nation anticipates the fact, or
imagines the fact, or substitutes its own passions for
the fact, it transcends the well-defined bounds of International
Law. Without the fact of independence,
positive and fixed, there is nothing but a claim. Now
nothing is clearer than, that, while the terrible litigation
is still pending, and the trial by battle, to which
appeal is made, remains undecided, <i>the fact of independence
cannot exist</i>. There is only a paper independence,
which, though reddened with blood, is no better
than a paper empire or a paper blockade; and any pretended
recognition of it is a wrongful intervention, inconsistent
with just neutrality, since the obvious effect
must be to encourage the insurgent party. Such has
been the declared judgment of our country, and its
practice, even under circumstances tempting in another
direction; and such, also, was the declared judgment
and practice of Great Britain with reference to Spanish
America.</p>

<p>The conclusion, then, is clear. To justify recognition,
it must appear beyond doubt that <i>de facto</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
contest is finished, and that <i>de facto</i> the new government
is established secure within fixed limits. <i>These
are conditions precedent</i>, not to be avoided without
open offence to a friendly power, and open violation
of that International Law which is the guardian of
the world’s peace, even if there be not <i>another condition
precedent</i> which civilization in this age will
require.</p>

<p>Do you ask now if foreign powers can acknowledge
our Rebel embryo as an independent nation? There
is madness in the thought. Recognition accompanied
by the breaking of the blockade would be war, impious
war, against the United States, where Slavemongers
would be the allies and Slavery the inspiration.
Of all wars in history, none more accursed, none more
sure to draw down upon its authors the judgment
alike of God and man. But the thought of recognition,
under existing circumstances, while the contest
is still pending, even without any breaking of the
blockade or attempted coercion, is a Satanic absurdity,
hardly less impious than the other. It would assume
unblushingly, that, already Rebel Slavery had
succeeded in establishing an independent nation with
an untroubled government and a secure conformation
of territory, when, <i>in fact</i>, nothing is established, nothing
untroubled, nothing secure, not even a single boundary-line,
and there is no element of independence except
the audacious attempt,&mdash;when, <i>in fact</i>, the conflict
is still waged on numerous battle-fields, and these
pretenders to independence have been driven from
State to State, driven away from the Mississippi
which parts them, driven back from the sea which
surrounds them, and shut up in the interior or in blockaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
ports, so that only by stealth can they communicate
with the outward world. Any recognition of
such a pretension, existing only as pretension, scouted
and denied by a whole people with invincible armies
and navies embattled against it, would be a mockery
of truth. It would assert independence as <i>a fact</i>, when
notoriously it was not <i>a fact</i>. It would be an enormous
lie. Naturally a power thus guilty would expect to
support the lie by arms.</p>


<h4>IV.</h4>

<p>I do not content myself with a single objection to
this outrageous consummation. There is another, of a
different nature. Assuming, for the moment, what I
glory to believe can never happen, that the <i>new</i> Slave
Power has become independent <i>in fact</i>, while the national
flag has sunk away exhausted in the contest,
there is one objection which, in an age of Christian
light, thank God, cannot be overcome, unless, after
solemn covenants branding Slavery, the great powers
shall forget their vows, while England, the declared protectress
of the African race, and France, the declared
champion of “ideas,” both break away from the irresistible
logic of their history, and turn their backs upon
the past. Vain is honor, vain is human confidence,
if these nations, at a moment of high duty, can thus
ignobly fail. “Renown and grace is dead.” Like the
other objection, this is <i>of fact</i> also,&mdash;for it is founded
on the character of the pretension claiming recognition,
which constitutes <i>fact</i>. Perhaps it may be said that
it is a question of policy; but it is of policy which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
ought to be beyond debate, <i>if such fact be established</i>.
Something more is necessary than that the new power
shall be <i>de facto</i> independent. <i>De facto</i> it must be
<i>fit</i> for independence; and, from the nature of the case,
every nation will judge of this fitness <i>in fact</i>. Undertaking
to acknowledge a <i>new</i> power, you proclaim
its fitness for welcome and association in the Family
of Nations. Can England gazette such a proclamation,
elevating the whippers of women and sellers of children?
Can France permit Louis Napoleon to do the
same?</p>

<p>Here, on the threshold of this inquiry, the true state
of the question must not be forgotten. It is not whether
old and existing relations shall be continued with a
power permitting Slavery, but <i>whether relations shall be
commenced with a new power</i>, not merely permitting Slavery,
but building its whole intolerable pretension upon
this Barbarism. “No <i>new</i> Slave State” is a watchword
with which we are familiar in our domestic history; but
even such cry does not reveal the full opposition to the
<i>new</i> revolt against Civilization,&mdash;for, even if disposed
to admit a <i>new</i> Slave State, there must be, among men
who have not yet lost all sense of decency, undying
resistance to the admission of a <i>new</i> Slave Power with
such an unquestioned origin and such an unquestioned
purpose as that which now flaunts in piracy and blood
before the civilized world, seeking recognition for its
criminal chimera. Here is nothing for nice casuistry.
Duty is plain as the moral law or the multiplication
table.</p>

<p>Look for a moment at the unprecedented character
of this pretension. A President known to be against
the extension of Slavery was duly elected by the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
in the autumn of 1860. This was all. He had not
entered upon his duties. But the apostolic Slavemongers
saw that Slavery at home must suffer under the
popular judgment against its extension; they saw that
a vote against its extension was a vote for its condemnation;
and they rebelled. Under this wicked inspiration,
State after State pretended to withdraw from
the Union, and to construct a new Confederacy, whose
“corner-stone” was Slavery. A Constitution was adopted,
declaring these words: (1.) “No law denying or
impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall
be passed”<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>; and (2.) “In all territory belonging to
the Confederate States, lying without the limits of the
several States, the institution of Negro Slavery, as it
now exists in the Confederate States, shall be recognized
and protected by Congress and by the Territorial
Government.”<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Do not start. These are the authentic
words of the text. You will find them in the Rebel
Constitution.</p>

<p>Such was the unalterable fabric of the new government.
Nor was there any doubt or hesitation in proclaiming
its distinctive character. Its Vice-President,
Mr. Stephens, thus far remarked for moderation on
Slavery, as if smitten with diabolic light, undertook
to explain and vindicate the new Magna Charta. His
words are familiar, but they cannot be omitted in a
complete statement of the case. “<i>The new Constitution</i>,”
he said, “has put at rest <i>forever</i> all the agitating
questions relating to our peculiar institution, African
Slavery, as it exists among us,” which he proceeds
to declare “was the immediate cause of the late rupture
and present revolution.” The Vice-President announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
unequivocally the change that had taken place.
Admitting it was “the prevailing idea of most of the
leading statesmen at the time of the formation of the
old Constitution that the enslavement of the African
was in violation of the Laws of Nature, that it was
wrong in principle, socially, morally, and politically,”
he denounces this idea as “fundamentally wrong,” and
proclaims the new government “founded upon <i>exactly
the opposite idea</i>.” Here is no disguise. “Its foundations,”
he avows, “are laid, its <i>corner-stone</i> rests, upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the
white man,&mdash;that Slavery, subordination to the superior
race, is his natural and normal condition.” Not
content with exhibiting the untried foundation, he
boastfully claims for the new government priority of
invention. “<i>This our new government</i>,” he vaunts, “<i>is
the first in the history of the world</i> based upon this
great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.…
This stone, which was rejected by the first builders,
‘is become the chief stone of the corner.’” And then,
as if priority of invention were not enough, he proceeds
to claim for the new government future supremacy,
saying that it is already “the nucleus of a growing
power, which, if we are true to ourselves, our destiny,
and our high mission, will become the controlling power
on this continent.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Since Satan first declared the “corner-stone” of his
new government, and openly denounced the Almighty
Throne, there has been no blasphemy of equal audacity.
In human history nothing but itself can be its parallel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
The gauntlet is thrown down to heaven and earth, while
a disgusting Barbarism is proclaimed as the new Civilization.
Here is a new method, a <i>novum organum</i>, to
usher in the world’s future. Two years are already
passed,&mdash;but, as the Rebellion began, so is it now. A
Governor of South Carolina, in a message to the Legislature,
as late as 3d April, 1863, takes up the boastful
strain, and congratulates the Rebel Slavemongers that
they are “a refined, cultivated, and enlightened people,”
and that the new government is “the finest type that
the world ever beheld.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> God save the mark! Such,
doubtless, was the speech of the African tyrant, as he
sat in state on the prostrate bodies of his subjects and
rejoiced in this manifestation of power. A leading journal,
more than any other the organ of the Slavemongers,
repeats the original vaunt with more than the original
brutality. After dwelling on “the grand career and lofty
destiny” before the new government, the “Richmond
Examiner” of 28th May, 1863, proceeds as follows.
“Would that all of us understood and laid to heart the
true nature of that career and that destiny, and the responsibility
it imposes. <i>The establishment of the Confederacy
is, verily, a distinct reaction against the whole
course of the mistaken civilization of the age.</i> For Liberty,
Equality, and Fraternity we have deliberately
substituted Slavery, Subordination, and Government.
<i>Reverently we feel that our Confederacy is a God-sent
missionary to the nations, with great truths to preach.</i>
We must speak thus boldly; but ‘whoso hath ears to
hear, let him hear.’” This God-sent missionary to the
nations it is now proposed to welcome at the household
hearth of the civilized world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>Unhappily, there are old nations already in the family
still tolerating Slavery; but now, for the first time,
a new nation claims admission there, which not only
tolerates Slavery, but, exulting in its shame, strives
to reverse the judgment of mankind, making this outrage
its chief support and glory, so that all recognition
of the new power will be recognition of a sacrilegious
pretension,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“With one vast blood-stone for the mighty base.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Elsewhere Slavery has been an accident; here it is the
principal. Elsewhere it has been an instrument only;
here it is the inspiration. Elsewhere it has been kept
back in becoming modesty; here it is pushed forward
in all its brutish nakedness. Elsewhere it has claimed
nothing but liberty to live; here it claims license to
rule, with unbounded empire at home and abroad.
Look at this candidate power in its whole continued
existence, from Alpha to Omega, and it is nothing but
Slavery. Its origin is Slavery, its mainspring is Slavery,
its object is Slavery. Wherever it appears, whatever
it does, whatever form it takes, it is Slavery and
nothing else; so that, with the agonizing despair of Satan,
it might cry out:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Me miserable! which way shall I fly</div>
<div class="verse">Infinite wrath and infinite despair?</div>
<div class="verse">Which way I fly is Hell; <i>myself am Hell</i>.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Rebellion is Slavery in arms, Slavery on horseback,
Slavery on foot, Slavery raging on the battle-field, Slavery
savage on the quarter-deck, robbing, destroying,
burning, killing, to uphold this candidate power. Its
legislation is simply Slavery in statutes, Slavery in
chapters, Slavery in sections, with an enacting clause.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Its diplomacy is Slavery in pretended ambassadors,
Slavery in cunning letters, Slavery in cozening promises,
Slavery in persistent negotiation,&mdash;all to secure
for the candidate power its much desired welcome. Say
what you will, try to avoid it, if you can, you are compelled
to admit that the candidate power is nothing
else than <i>organized Slavery</i>, now, in its madness, surrounded
by its criminal clan, and led by its felon chieftains,
braving the civilization of the age. Any recognition
of Slavery is bad enough; but this will be recognition
with welcome and benediction, imparting <i>new</i>
consideration and respectability, and, worse still, securing
<i>new</i> opportunity and foothold for the supremacy it
openly proclaims.</p>

<p>In ancient days the candidate was robed in white,
while at the Capitol and in the Forum he canvassed the
people for their votes. The candidate nation, unashamed
of Slavery, should be robed in black, while it conducts
the great canvass, and asks the votes of the Christian
powers. “Hung be the heavens with black, yield day
to night,” as the outrage proceeds; for the candidate
gravely asks international recognition of the claim to
hold property in man, to sell wife away from husband,
to sell child away from parent, to shut the gates of
knowledge, to appropriate all the fruits of another’s
labor. The candidate proceeds in the canvass, notwithstanding
all history declares Slavery essentially
barbarous, and that whatever it touches it changes to
itself,&mdash;that it barbarizes laws, barbarizes business,
barbarizes manners, barbarizes social life, and makes
the people who cherish it barbarians. And still the
candidate proceeds, although it is known to the Christian
powers that the partisans of Slavery are naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
“filibusters,” always apt for lawless incursion
and for robbery; that, during later years, under their
instigation and to advance their pretensions, expeditions
<i>identical in motive with the present Rebellion</i>
were let loose in the Gulf of Mexico, twice against
Cuba, and twice, also, against Nicaragua, breaking the
peace of the United States and threatening the repose
of the world, so that Lopez and Walker were but predecessors
of Beauregard and Jefferson Davis. And
yet the candidate proceeds, although it is obvious that
the recognition urged will be nothing less than solemn
sanction by the Christian powers of Slavery everywhere
throughout the new jurisdiction, on land or sea,
so that every ship, being part of <i>the floating territory</i>,
will be <i>Slave Territory</i>. And yet, with the phantasy
that man can hold property in man shooting
from his lips, with the shackle and lash in his hands,
with barbarism on his forehead, with filibusterism in
his recorded life, and with Slavery woven in his flag
wherever it floats on land and sea, the candidate clamors
for independent recognition. It is sad to think that
there is delay in repelling the insufferable canvass.
Can Christian nations longer hesitate? To detest and
combat such an accursed pretension it is not necessary
even to be a Christian,&mdash;it is sufficient to be a
man.</p>

<p>If the recognition of a <i>de facto</i> power were a duty
imposed upon other nations by International Law, there
would be no opportunity for objections founded on principle
or policy. <i>But there is no such duty.</i> International
Law leaves to each nation, precisely as the Municipal
Law leaves to each citizen, what company to keep or
what copartnership to form. No company and no copartnership<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
can be forced upon a nation. It is all a
question of free choice and acceptance. International
Law on this head is like the Constitution of the United
States, which declares, “New States <i>may be admitted</i>
by the Congress into this Union.” Not <i>must</i>, but <i>may</i>,&mdash;it
being in the discretion of Congress to determine
whether the State shall be admitted. Accordingly, in
the exercise of this discretion, Congress for a long time
refused to admit Missouri <i>as a Slave State</i>. And now
the old Missouri Question, in more outrageous form,
on vaster theatre, with “monarchs to behold the swelling
scene,” is presented to the Christian powers of the
world. If it was right to exclude Missouri, having only
few slaves, and regarding Slavery merely as a temporary
condition, it must be right to exclude a pretended
nation, which not only boasts millions of slaves, but
passionately proclaims the perpetuity and propagation
of Slavery as the cause and object of its separate existence.</p>

<p>Practical statesmen have always treated recognition
as a question of policy, to be determined on the whole
case, even where the power is <i>de facto</i> established,&mdash;as
amply appears in the Parliamentary debates on the
recognition of Spanish America. If we go behind the
practical statesmen and consult the earliest oracles
of International Law, we find, that, according to their
most approved utterances, not only may recognition be
refused, but there are considerations of duty this way
which cannot be evaded. It is not enough that a pretender
has the form of a commonwealth. “A people,”
says Cicero, in a definition copied by most jurists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> “is
not every body of men, <i>howsoever</i> congregated, but a
gathered multitude <i>associated through agreement in right
and community of interest</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Again, he goes so far as
to say, “When the king is unjust, or the aristocracy,
or the people itself, the commonwealth is not vicious,
<i>but null</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Of course a commonwealth that is <i>null</i> cannot
be recognized. This same lofty standard is of frequent
recurrence in the testimony of the great Roman.
But he is not alone. Grotius, who speaks always with
the magistral voice of learning and genius, furnishes
the just conclusion, when, after declaring that a state
is “a complete body of freemen associated for the enjoyment
of right and for their common benefit,”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> he
exposes the distinction between a body of men, who,
being already a recognized commonwealth, are guilty
of systematic crime,&mdash;as, for instance, piracy,&mdash;and
another body of men, who, <i>not yet recognized as a commonwealth</i>,
band together for this purpose,&mdash;<i>sceleris
causâ coeunt</i>. The latter, by happy discrimination, he
places beyond the pale of recognition.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> When before,
in all history, have creatures wearing the human form
proclaimed the <i>criminal principle</i> of their association
with the audacity of our Slavemongers? And yet
there is hesitation to place them beyond the pale of
recognition. A recent English authority on the Law
of Nations adopts the same distinction. I quote Mr.
Phillimore, who, after alluding to societies united <i>for
the sake of crime</i>, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> “All agree to class such bodies
amongst those of whose corporate existence the law
takes no cognizance (<i>qui civitatem non faciunt</i>), and
therefore as not entitled to international rights either
in peace or war.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>It might be argued, on grounds of reason and authority
even, that the <i>declared principle</i> of the pretended
power was a violation of International Law.
Eminent magistrates have solemnly ruled, that, in the
development of civilization, the Slave-Trade has become
illegal by a law higher than any statute. Sir
William Grant, an ornament of the British bench,
whose elegant mind was governed always by practical
sense, adjudged that this trade “cannot, <i>abstractedly
speaking</i>, be said to have a legitimate existence”;<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and
our own great authority, Mr. Justice Story, in a remarkable
judgment, declared himself constrained “to
consider the trade <i>an offence against the universal law
of society</i>”;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> and the highest professional authorities of
our country adopted the same conclusion: I refer especially
to the late William Pinkney and Jeremiah
Mason.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But arguments which are strong against any
recognition of the Slave-Trade are strong also against
any recognition of Slavery itself, especially when it is
the foundation of a <i>new</i> power.</p>

<p>In the determination of present duty, it is not necessary
to assume that Slavery or the Slave-Trade is
positively forbidden by existing International Law. It
is enough to show, that, <i>according to the spirit</i> of that
sovereign law which “sits empress, crowning good, repressing
ill,” and also according to those commanding
principles of justice and humanity which cannot be set
at nought without shock to human nature itself, so foul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
a wrong as Slavery can receive no voluntary support
from the Commonwealth of Nations. It is not a question
of Law, but of Morality. The Rule of Law is sometimes
less comprehensive than the Rule of Morality, so
that the latter may positively condemn what the former
silently tolerates. But within its own domain Morality
cannot be less authoritative than Law. It is, indeed,
nothing less than the Law of Nature, which is the
Law of God. If we listen again to heathen teaching,
we shall confess its truth. “Law,” says Cicero, “is the
highest reason, implanted in nature, <i>which prescribes those
things which ought to be done, and forbids the contrary</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
This law is an essential part of International Law, as is
also Christianity itself, and where treaties fail and usage
is silent it is the only law between nations. Jurists of
all ages and countries have delighted to acknowledge
its authority, if it spoke only in the still, small voice of
conscience. A celebrated professor of Germany in our
own day, Savigny, whose name is honored by students
of jurisprudence everywhere, touches upon this monitor
of nations, when he declares that “there may exist between
different nations <i>a common consciousness of right</i>
similar to that which engenders the positive law of particular
nations.”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> This common consciousness of right
is identical with that law, which, according to Cicero,
is “the highest reason, implanted in nature.” Such is
the <i>Rule of Morality</i>.</p>

<p>The Rule of Morality differs from the Rule of Law
in this respect,&mdash;that the former finds support in the
human conscience, the latter in the sanctions of public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
force. But moral power prevails with a good man as
much as if it were physical. I know no different rule
for a good nation than for a good man. I am sure
that a good nation will not do what a good man would
scorn to do.</p>

<p>There is a Rule of Prudence superadded to the Rule
of Morality. Grotius, in discussing treaties, does not
forget the wisdom of Solomon, who, in not a few places,
warns against fellowship with the wicked,&mdash;although
he adds, that these are maxims of prudence, and not of
law.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> And he reminds us of the saying of Alexander,
“that those grievously offend who enter the service of
barbarians.”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Better still are the words of the wise historian
of classical antiquity, who enjoins upon a commonwealth
the duty of considering carefully, when sued
for assistance, “whether what is sought is sufficiently
pious, safe, glorious, or whether it is <i>unbecoming</i>”;<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and
also those words of the Hebrew king, who, after rebuking
an alliance with Ahab, asks with scorn, “Shouldest
thou help the ungodly?”<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>The claim for recognition, when brought to the touchstone
of these principles, is easily disposed of.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Urge not the <i>Practice of Nations</i> in its behalf. Never
before in history has a candidacy been put forward <i>in
the name of Slavery</i>, and the terrible outrage is aggravated
by the Christian light which surrounds it. This
is not an age of darkness. But even in the Dark Ages,
when the Slavemongers of the Barbary coast had gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
into cities, the saintly Louis the Ninth was fired
to treat one of these communities as a “nest of wasps.”<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
Afterwards, but slowly, they obtained “the right of legation”
and “the reputation of a government”; when
at last, weary of their criminal pretensions, the aroused
vengeance of Great Britain and France blotted out this
power from the list of nations. Louis the Eleventh, who
has been described as the sovereign “who best understood
his interest,” indignant at Richard the Third of England,
who had murdered two infants in the Tower and
usurped the crown, sent back his ambassadors without
holding intercourse with them. This is a suggestive
precedent, which I give on venerable authority in diplomatic
history;<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> but the parricide usurper of England
had never murdered so many infants or usurped
so much as the pretended Slave Power, strangely tolerated
by the sagacious sovereign who sits on the throne
of Louis the Eleventh.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to go so far in history,
nor to dwell on the practice of nations in withholding
or conceding recognition. The whole matter is stated
by Burke, with his customary power.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the case of a divided kingdom, by the Law of Nations,
Great Britain, like every other power, is free to take any
part she pleases. <i>She may decline, with more or less formality,
according to her discretion, to acknowledge this new system</i>; or
she may recognize it as a government <i>de facto</i>, setting aside
all discussion of its original legality, and considering the ancient
monarchy as at an end. The Law of Nations leaves
our court open to its choice.… The declaration of a <i>new</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><i>species</i> of government on new principles is a real crisis in the
politics of Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This same rule Burke declared in Parliament, saying,
“that the French Republic was <i>sui generis</i>, and bore no
analogy to any other that ever existed in the world.
It, therefore, did not follow that we ought to recognize
it, merely because different powers in Europe had recognized
the Republic of England under Oliver Cromwell.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
And in his famous “Appeal from the New to the Old
Whigs” this illustrious authority proclaimed the new
French Government “so fundamentally wrong as to be
utterly incapable of correcting itself by any length of
time, or of being formed into any mode of polity of
which a member of the House of Commons could publicly
declare his approbation.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Another eloquent publicist, Sir James Mackintosh,
while pressing on Parliament the recognition of Spanish
America, says: “The reception of a new state into
the society of civilized nations by those acts which
amount to recognition is a proceeding which has no
legal character, and <i>is purely of a moral nature</i>”; and
he proceeds to argue, that, since England “is the only
anciently free state in the world, for her to refuse her
<i>moral aid to communities struggling for liberty</i> is an
act of unnatural harshness.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Thus does he vindicate
recognition for the sake of Freedom. How truly he
would have repelled any recognition for the sake of
Slavery let his life testify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>At the Congress of Verona, Chateaubriand, as representative
of France, replied to a proposition from the
Duke of Wellington on this subject:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“France is influenced by considerations of more general
importance with regard to the governments <i>de facto</i>. She
conceives that <i>the principles of justice on which society is
founded must not be lightly sacrificed</i> to secondary interests,
and it appears to her that those principles increase in importance
<i>when the matter in question is that of recognizing a political
order of things virtually hostile to that which exists in
Europe</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the rule is mildly stated, but in harmony with
correct principle. A <i>new</i> government, with Slavery as
its active soul, must be “virtually hostile” to European
civilization, so as to make its recognition impossible;
nor can the principles of justice be lightly sacrificed.</p>

<p>No better testimony to the practice of nations can be
found than the words of Vattel, whose work, presenting
the subject in familiar form, has done more, during the
last century, to fashion opinion on the Law of Nations
than any other authority. Here it is briefly.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If there be any nation that <i>makes an open profession</i> of
trampling justice under foot, of despising and violating the
rights of others, whenever it finds an opportunity, the interest
of human society will authorize all others to unite in
order to humble and chastise it.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>“<i>To form and support an unjust pretension</i> is to do an
injury only to the nation whom such pretension concerns;
to mock at justice in general is to injure all nations.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<p>“The power that assists an odious tyrant, that declares
for an unjust and rebellious people, undoubtedly violates
duty.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>“As to those monsters who under the title of sovereigns
render themselves the scourges and horror of humanity,
they are ferocious beasts, of whom every brave man may
justly clear the earth.”<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>“If the maxims of a religion tend to establish it by
violence, and to oppress all those who do not embrace it,
the Law of Nature forbids us to favor that religion, or to
unite unnecessarily with its inhuman followers, and the
common safety of mankind invites them rather to enter
into <i>a league against such madmen, to repress such fanatics,
who disturb the public repose and menace all nations</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor can you urge this recognition on any principle
of <i>Comity of Nations</i>. This is an expansive term, into
which enters much of the refinements, amenities, and
hospitalities of civilization, and also something of the
obligations of moral duty. But where an act is prejudicial
to national interests, or contrary to national policy,
or questionable in morals, it cannot be commended
by any consideration of courtesy. A paramount duty
must not be betrayed by a kiss. For the sake of comity,
acts of good-will and friendship not required by law
are performed between nations; but an English court
has authoritatively declared that this principle cannot
prevail, “where it violates the law of our own country,
the Law of Nature, or the Law of God,” and on this
exalted ground it was decided that an American slave
who had found shelter on board a British man-of-war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
on the high seas could not be recognized as a slave.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
The same principle must prevail against recognition of
a new slave nation.</p>

<p>Nor, finally, can this recognition be urged on any reason
of <i>Peace</i>. There can be no peace founded on injustice;
and any recognition is injustice which will cry
aloud, resounding through the earth. You may seem to
have peace, but it will be only smothered war, sure to
break forth in war more direful than before.</p>

<p>Thus is every argument for recognition repelled,
whether under the sounding words, Practice of Nations,
Comity of Nations, or Peace. There is nothing in practice,
nothing in comity, nothing in peace, which is not
against any such shameful acknowledgment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Applying the principles already set forth,&mdash;assuming
what cannot be denied, that every power is free to
refuse recognition,&mdash;assuming that it is not every body
of men that can be considered a commonwealth, but
only those “associated <i>through agreement in right and
community of interest</i>,”&mdash;that men “banding together
for the sake of systematic crime” cannot be considered
a commonwealth,&mdash;assuming that every member of the
Family of Nations will surely obey the rule of morality,&mdash;that
it will “shun fellowship with the wicked,”&mdash;that
it will not “enter the service of barbarians,”&mdash;that it
will avoid what is “unbecoming,” and do that only
which is “pious, safe, and glorious,”&mdash;and that, above
all things, it will not enter into alliance to “help the
ungodly,”&mdash;assuming these things, every such member
must reject with indignation a new pretension whose
declared principle of association is so intrinsically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
wicked. Here there can be no question. The case
is plain; nor is any language of contumely or scorn
too strong to express the irrepressible repugnance to
such a pretension, which, like vice, “to be hated needs
but to be seen.” Surely there can be no Christian
power which will not rouse to expose it, crying, with
irresistible voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>No <i>new</i> sanction of Slavery!</p>

<p>No <i>new</i> quickening of Slavery in its active and aggressive
barbarism!</p>

<p>No <i>new</i> encouragement to “filibusters” engendered by
Slavery!</p>

<p>No <i>new</i> creation of <i>Slave Territory</i>!</p>

<p>No <i>new</i> creation of a <i>Slave Navy</i>!</p>

<p><i>No new Slave Nation!</i></p>

<p>No installation of Slavery as a <i>new</i> Civilization!</p>

<p>But all this litany will fail, if recognition succeeds,&mdash;from
which, good Lord, deliver us! Nor will this be the
end.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Slavery, through the <i>new</i> power, will take its place
in the Parliament of mankind, with the immunities of
an independent nation, ready always to uphold and
advance itself, and organized as an unrelenting Propaganda
of the new faith. A power having its inspiration
in such a Barbarism must be essentially barbarous;
founded on the asserted right to whip women and sell
children, it must assume a character of disgusting hardihood;
and openly professing determination to revolutionize
the public opinion of the world, it must be in
open schism with Civilization itself, so that all its influences
will be wild, savage, brutal, and all its offspring
kindred in character.</p>

<p>Such a power, from very nature, must be despotism
at home “tempered only by assassination,” with the
cotton-field for its Siberia,&mdash;while abroad it must be
aggressive, dangerous, and revolting, in itself a <i>Magnum
Latrocinium</i>, whose fellowship can have nothing but
“the filthiness of evil,” and whose very existence will
be an intolerable nuisance. When Dante, in the vindictive
judgment hurled against his own Florence, called
it <i>bordello</i>, he did not use a term too strong for the
mighty house of ill-fame which the Christian powers
are now asked for the first time to license. Such must
be the character of the new power. But, though only
a recent wrong, and pleading no prescription, the illimitable
audacity of its nature can hesitate at nothing;
nor is there anything offensive or detestable it
will not absorb into itself. It will be an Ishmael, with
hand against every man. It will be a brood of Harpies,
defiling all it cannot steal. It will be the one-eyed Cyclop

the wretched creation of human science without

raging madly, the scandal to humanity, powerful only

of the world.</p>

<p>Who can welcome such a creation? Who can consort
with it? There is something loathsome in the idea.
There is contamination even in the thought. If you
live with the lame, says the ancient proverb, you will
learn to limp; if you keep in the kitchen, you will smell
of smoke; if you touch pitch, you will be defiled. But
what limp so mean as that of this pretended power?
what smoke so foul as its breath? what pitch so defiling
as its touch? It is an Oriental saying, that a cistern
of rosewater will become impure, if a dog be dropped
into it; but an ocean of rosewater with Rebel Slavemongers
would be changed into a vulgar puddle. Imagine
whatever is most disgusting, and this pretended
power is more disgusting still. Naturalists report that
the pike will swallow anything except the toad, but
this it cannot do. The experiment has been tried, and
though this fish, in unhesitating voracity, always gulps
whatever is thrown to it, yet invariably it spews the
nuisance from its throat. Our Slavemonger pretension
is worse than toad; and yet there are foreign nations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
which, instead of spewing it forth, are already turning
it like a precious morsel on the tongue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is yet another ground on which I make this
appeal. It is part of the triumphs of Civilization, that
no nation can act for itself alone. Whatever it does for
good or for evil affects all the rest. Therefore a nation
cannot forget its obligations to others. Especially does
International Law, when it declares the absolute equality
of independent nations, cast upon all the duty of
considering well how this privilege shall be bestowed
so that the welfare of all may be best upheld. But
the whole Family of Nations would be degraded by
admitting this new pretension to any toleration, much
more to equality. There can be no reason for such admission;
for it can bring nothing to the general weal.
Civil society is created for safety and tranquillity. Nations
come together and fraternize for the common good.
But this hateful pretension can do nothing but evil for
civil society at home or for nations in their intercourse
with each other. It can show no title to recognition,
no passport for its travels, no old existence. It is all
new. And here I borrow the language of Burke on
another occasion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not a new power of an old kind. <i>It is a new power
of a new species.</i> When such a questionable shape is <i>to be
admitted for the first time</i> into the brotherhood of Christendom,
it is not a mere matter of idle curiosity to consider
<i>how far it is in its nature alliable with the rest</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The greatest of corporations is a nation; the sublimest
of all associations is that composed of nations, independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and equal, knit together in the bonds of peaceful
fraternity as the great Christian Commonwealth. The
Slavemongers may be a corporation <i>in fact</i>, but no such
corporation can find place in that august Commonwealth.
As well admit the Thugs, whose first article of faith is
to kill the stranger,&mdash;or the Buccaneers, those “brothers
of the coast,” who plundered on the sea; or, better
still, revive the old Kingdom of the Assassins, where
the king was an assassin, surrounded by counsellors and
generals who were assassins, and all his subjects were
assassins; or yet again, better at once and openly recognize
Antichrist, the supreme and highest impersonation
of the Slave Power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Amidst the general degradation following such obeisance
to Slavery, there are two Christian powers that
would appear in sad and shameful eminence. I refer
to Great Britain, declared protectress of the African
race, and to France, declared champion of “ideas,” who,
from the very abundance of pledges, are so situated that
they cannot desert the good old cause and turn their
faces against civilization without criminal tergiversation,
which no mantle of diplomacy can cover. Where, then,
is British devotion to the African race, so eloquently
proclaimed by the British Minister? Where, then, is
French devotion to ideas, so ostentatiously announced
by the French Emperor? Remembered only to point
a tale and show how nations have fallen. Great Britain
knows less than France of national vicissitudes, but such
an act of wrong would do something in its influence to
equalize the conditions of these two nations. Rather
than do this thing, better for the fast-anchored isle that
it should sink beneath the sea, carrying down its cathedrals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
its castles, its happy homes, its fields of glory,
Runnymede, Westminster Hall, and the tomb of Shakespeare.
In other days England has valiantly striven
against Slavery, winning a truer glory than any achieved
by her arms on land or sea; and now she is willing to
surrender, at a moment when more can be done than
ever before against the monster, wherever it shows its
head,&mdash;for Slavery everywhere has its neck in this Rebellion.
In other days France has valiantly striven for
ideas; and now she, too, proposes surrender, although all
that she professes at heart is involved in the doom of
Slavery, which a word from her might hasten beyond
recall. It is in England, where the great victory of
Emancipation was first obtained, that now, more even
than in France, the strongest sentiment for Rebel Slavemongers
is manifest, constituting a <i>moral mania</i> which
menaces a pact and <i>concordat</i> with the Rebellion itself,&mdash;as
when an early Pope, head of the Christian Church,
did not hesitate to execute a piratical convention with
a Pagan enemy to the Christian name. It only remains
that the new coalition should be signed in order to consummate
the unutterable degradation. The contracting
parties will be the Queen of England and Jefferson Davis,
once patron of “Repudiation,” now chief of Rebel
Slavery. Then must this virtuous lady, whose pride is
justice always, bend to receive the author of the Fugitive
Slave Bill as ambassadorial plenipotentiary at her
Court.</p>

<p>A new power, dedicated to Slavery, will take its seat
at the great council-board, to jostle thrones and benches,
while it overshadows humanity. Its foul attorneys,
reeking with Slavery, will have their letter of license
as ambassadors of Slavery, to rove from court to court,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
over foreign carpets, poisoning the air which has been
nobly pronounced too pure for a slave to breathe. Alas
for England, vowed a thousand times to the protection
of the African race, and by her best renown knit perpetually
to this sacred loyalty, now plunging into adulterous
dalliance with Slavery, recognizing the new and
impious Protestantism against Liberty itself, and wickedly
becoming <i>Defender of the Faith</i> as now professed
by Rebel Slavemongers! Alas for England’s Queen,
woman and mother, carried off from the cause of Wilberforce
and Clarkson to sink into unseemly association
with the scourgers of women and the auctioneers
of children!&mdash;for a “stain” deeper than that which
aroused the anguish of Maria Theresa is settling upon
her reign. Alas for that Royal Consort, humane and
just, whose dying voice was given to assuage the temper
of that ministerial despatch, by which, in an evil
hour, England was made to strike hands with Rebel
Slavery!&mdash;for the counsellor is needed now to save the
land he adorned from an act of inexpiable shame.</p>

<p>And for all this sickening immorality I hear but one
declared apology. It is, that the Union permitted and
still permits Slavery,&mdash;therefore foreign nations may
recognize Rebel Slavery as a <i>new</i> power. Here is the
precise error. England is still in diplomatic relations
with Spain, and was only a short time ago in diplomatic
relations with Brazil, both permitting Slavery; but these
two powers are not <i>new</i>, they are already established,
there is no question of recognition, nor do they pretend
to found empire on Slavery. There is no reason in any
relations with them why a <i>new</i> power, with Slavery as
its declared “corner-stone,” whose gospel is Slavery, and
whose evangelists are Slavemongers, should be recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
in the Family of Nations. If Ireland were in
triumphant rebellion against the British Queen, complaining
of rights denied, it would be our duty to
recognize her as an independent power; but if Ireland
rebelled with the declared object of establishing
a <i>new</i> power which should be nothing less than a giant
felony and a nuisance to the world, then it would
be our duty to spurn the infamous pretension, and no
triumph of rebellion could change this plain and irresistible
obligation. And yet, in face of this commanding
rule, we are told to expect the recognition of Rebel
Slavery.</p>

<p>An aroused public opinion, “the world’s collected
will,” and returning reason in England and France, will
see to it that Civilization is saved from this shock, and
the nations themselves from the terrible retribution
which sooner or later must surely attend it. No power
can afford to stand up before mankind and openly vote
a new and untrammelled charter to injustice and cruelty.
God is an unsleeping avenger; nor can armies,
fleets, bulwarks, or “towers along the steep” prevail
against His mighty anger. To any application for this
unholy recognition there is but one word the Christian
powers can utter. It is simply and austerely “No,” with
an emphasis that shall silence argument and extinguish
hope itself. And this proclamation should go forth
swiftly. Every moment of hesitation is a moment of
apostasy, casting its lengthening shadow of dishonor.
Not to discourage is to encourage; not to blast is to
bless. Let this simple word be uttered, and Slavery
will slink away with a mark on its forehead, like Cain,
a perpetual vagabond, forever accursed; and the malediction
of the Lord shall descend upon it, saying:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
“Among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither
shall the sole of thy foot have rest; but the Lord shall
give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes
and sorrow of mind; and thy life shall hang in doubt
before thee, and thou shalt fear day and night, and shalt
have none assurance of thy life; in the morning thou
shalt say, Would God it were even, and at even thou
shalt say, Would God it were morning.”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>


<h4>V.</h4>

<p>Too much have I spoken for your patience, if not
enough for the cause. But there is yet another topic,
which I have reserved to the last, because logically it
belongs there, or at least can be best considered in the
gathered light of the previous discussion. Its immediate
practical interest is great. I refer to the <i>Concession of
Belligerent Rights</i>, being the first stage to independence.
Great Britain led the way in acknowledging the embryo
government as belligerent on sea as well as land, and
by proclamation of the Queen declared neutrality between
the two parties,&mdash;thus lifting an embryo, which
was nothing else than animate Slavery, to equality <i>on
sea</i> as well as land with its ancient ally, the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
Government. Here was a blunder, if not a crime, not
merely in the alacrity with which it was done, but in
doing it at all. It was followed immediately by France,
and then by Spain, Holland, and Brazil. The concession
of belligerent rights on land was a name and
nothing more, therefore I say nothing about it. But
the concession of <i>belligerent rights on the ocean</i> is of
widely different character, and the two reasons against
the recognition of independence are equally applicable
to this concession: <i>first</i>, the embryo government has no
<i>maritime</i> or <i>naval</i> belligerent rights <i>de facto</i>, and, <i>secondly</i>,
an embryo of Rebel Slavery cannot have the
character <i>de facto</i> which would justify the concession
of <i>maritime</i> or <i>naval</i> belligerence; so that, were the
concession vindicated on the first ground, it must fail
on the second.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The concession of <i>ocean</i> belligerence is a letter of
license from consenting powers to every Slavemonger
cruiser, or rather it is the countersign of these powers
to the commission of every such cruiser. Without such
countersign the cruiser would be an outlaw, with no
right to enter a foreign port. The declaration of belligerence
imparts legal competence, and the right to
testify by flag and arms. Without such competence
there would be no flag and no right to bear arms on
the ocean. Burke sententiously describes it as an “intermediate
treaty <i>which puts rebels in possession of the
Law of Nations with regard to war</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> And this is
plainly true.</p>

<p>The magnitude of this concession may be seen in
three aspects: <i>first</i>, in the immunities it confers, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
an embryo of Rebel Slavery on <i>equality</i> with established
governments, making its cruisers lawful instead
of piratical, and opening to them boundless facilities at
sea and in port, so that they may obtain supplies and
hospitality; <i>secondly</i>, in the degradation it fastens upon
the National Government, which is condemned to see
its ships treated on <i>equality</i> with the ships of Rebel
Slavery, and also the just rule of “neutrality” between
belligerent powers invoked to fetter its activity against
a giant felony; and, <i>thirdly</i>, in the disturbance to commerce
it sanctions, by letting loose lawless sea-rovers
armed with belligerent rights, including the right of
search, whose natural recklessness is left unbridled and
without remedy even from diplomatic intercourse. The
ocean is a common highway; but it is for the interest
of all who traverse it that the highway should not be
disturbed by predatory hostilities. Such a concession
should be made with the greatest caution, and then only
under the necessity of the case, on the overwhelming
authority of <i>the fact</i>: for, from beginning to end, it is
simply a question of fact, absolutely dependent on those
conditions and prerequisites without which ocean belligerence
cannot exist.</p>

<p>As a general rule, belligerent rights are conceded only
where a rebel government or contending party in a civil
war has acquired such form and body, that, for the time
being, within certain limits, it is sovereign <i>de facto</i>, so far
at least as to command troops and <i>to administer justice</i>.
On this last point I dwell especially. It is the capacity
to administer justice which is the criterion, whether on
land or ocean. The concession of belligerence is the
recognition of such limited sovereignty, which bears
the same relation to acknowledged independence as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
gristle bears to bone. It is obvious that such sovereignty
may exist <i>de facto</i> on land without existing <i>de
facto</i> on ocean. It may prevail in armies, and yet fail in
navies. In short, <i>the fact</i> may be one way on land and
the other way <i>on ocean</i>. Nor can it be inferred on ocean
simply from existence on land. Our Supreme Court
has declared that there may be “a limited, partial war,”
“a restrained or limited hostility,” “an imperfect war,
or a war as to certain objects and to a certain extent.”
Thus, on one occasion, hostilities were authorized “on
the high seas by certain persons in certain cases,” but
without authority “to commit hostilities on land.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
But by the same rule there may be war on land and
not on sea, and this may follow from the necessity of
the case. If Rebel Slavery does not come within the
conditions of ocean war, then, whatever its belligerence
on land, it cannot expect it on the ocean. Since every
such concession is adverse to the original government,
and is made only under the necessity of the case, it
must be limited carefully to <i>the actual fact</i>. Indeed,
Mr. Canning, who has shed so much light on these topics,
openly took the ground that “belligerency is not so
much a principle as <i>a fact</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> And the question then
arises, whether Rebel Slavery has acquired such <i>de
facto</i> sovereignty on the ocean as entitles it to <i>ocean</i>
belligerent rights.</p>

<p>There are at least two “facts” patent to all: <i>first</i>,
that Rebel Slavery is without a single port into which
even legal cruisers can take prizes for adjudication;
and, <i>secondly</i>, that the ships which now presume to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
exercise <i>ocean</i> belligerent rights in its name&mdash;constituting
that navy which a member of the British Cabinet
announced as “to be created”&mdash;were all “created”
in England, which is the <i>naval base</i> from which they
sally forth on predatory cruise, without once entering a
port of their own pretended government.</p>

<p>These two “facts” are different in nature. The first
attaches absolutely to the pretended power, rendering
it incompetent to exercise <i>belligerent jurisdiction</i> on the
ocean. The second attaches to the individual ships,
rendering them piratical. These simple and unquestionable
“facts” are the key to unlock the present
question.</p>

<p>From the reason of the case, there can be no <i>ocean</i>
belligerent without a port into which it can take prizes.
Any other rule is absurd. It is not enough to sail the
sea, like the Flying Dutchman; the <i>ocean</i> belligerent
must be able to touch the land, and that land its own.
This proceeds on the idea of civilized warfare, that
something more than <i>naked force</i> is essential to the
completeness of capture. According to the earlier rule,
transmutation of property was accomplished by the
“pernoctation” of the captured ship within the port of
the belligerent,&mdash;or, as it was called, <i>deductio infra
præsidia</i>. As early as 1414, under Henry the Fifth
of England, there was an Act of Parliament requiring
privateers <i>to bring their prizes into a port of the kingdom</i>,
and to make a declaration thereof to a proper officer,
<i>before undertaking to dispose of them</i>.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The modern
rule interposes an additional check upon lawless violence,
by requiring the condemnation of a competent
court. This rule, which is among the most authoritative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
of the British Admiralty, is found in the famous letter
of Sir William Scott and Sir John Nicholl, addressed to
John Jay, as follows: “<i>Before the ship or goods can be
disposed of by the captor</i>, there must be a regular judicial
proceeding, wherein both parties may be heard, and
condemnation thereupon as prize, in a Court of Admiralty,
judging by the Law of Nations and treaties.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
This is explicit, and is plainly necessary for the protection
of neutral commerce. But this rule is French as
well as English. It is part of International Law. A
<i>seizure</i> is regarded merely as a <i>preliminary</i> act, which
does not divest the property, though it paralyzes the
right of the proprietor. A subsequent act of condemnation
by a competent tribunal is necessary to determine
if the seizure is valid. The question is compendiously
called <i>Prize or No Prize</i>. Where the property
of neutrals is involved, this requirement becomes of
absolute necessity. In conceding belligerence, all customary
belligerent rights with regard to neutrals are
conceded also, so that neutral rights and interests are
put in jeopardy. Here we see at once the wrong done.
If nothing is due to Civilization, something is due to
neutrals. Without dwelling on this point, I content
myself with the authority of two recent French writers.
M. Hautefeuille, in his elaborate work, says: “The
cruiser is not recognized as the proprietor of the objects
seized, he cannot dispose of them, but <i>it is his duty
to present himself before the tribunal and obtain a sentence
declaring them to be prize</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> A later writer, M.
Eugène Cauchy, whose work has appeared since our
war began, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> “A usage which evidently has its
source in <i>natural equity</i> requires, that, before proceeding
to divide the booty, there should be an inquiry as
to the regularity of the prize. <i>Every prize taken from
an enemy should be carried before the judge established by
the sovereign of the captor.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> But if the power calling
itself belligerent cannot comply with this condition,&mdash;if
it has no port into which it can bring the captured
ship, and no court, according to the requirement of the
British Admiralty, with “a regular judicial proceeding
wherein both parties may be heard,”&mdash;it is clearly <i>not
in a situation to dispose of a ship or goods as prize</i>.
Whatever its force in other respects, it lacks a vital
element of <i>ocean</i> belligerence. In that <i>semi</i>-sovereignty
which constitutes belligerence on land there must
be provision for the <i>administration of justice</i>, without
which there is nothing but a mob. In that same <i>semi</i>-sovereignty
on the ocean there must be similar provision.
It is not enough that there are ships duly commissioned
to take prizes, there must also be courts to
try them; and the latter are not less important than
the former. Such is the conclusion of reason, in harmony
with acknowledged principles. How, then, acknowledge
belligerent rights where this condition is
wanting?</p>

<p>Earl Russell himself, so swift to make this concession,
is led to confess the necessity of Prize Courts on
the part of <i>ocean</i> belligerents, and thus exposes the irrational
character of his own work. In a letter to the Liverpool
Chamber of Commerce, occasioned by the destruction
of British cargoes, the Minister says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> “The owners
of any British property, not being contraband of war,
on board a Federal vessel captured and destroyed by a
Confederate vessel of war, <i>may claim in a Confederate
Prize Court compensation for destruction of such property</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
Even in the very speech announcing the belligerent
rights of our Rebels, including the right to visit
and detain British merchant vessels having enemy’s
property on board and to confiscate such property, Earl
Russell was compelled to declare, that “it was <i>necessarily
implied</i>, as a condition of such acknowledgment,
that the detention was for the purpose of bringing the
vessels detained before an established Court of Prize,
and that confiscation did not take place until after condemnation
by such competent tribunal.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Such was the
express condition, obviously to secure justice. If there
be no Prize Court, then justice must fail; and with this
failure tumbles <i>in fact</i> the whole wretched pretension of
<i>ocean</i> belligerence, except in the galvanism of a Queen’s
proclamation or a Cabinet concession.</p>

<p>If a cruiser may at any time burn prizes, it is because
of some exceptional exigency in a particular case, and
not according to general rule, which practically declares
that there can be no right to take a prize, if there be no
port into which it may be carried. The right of capture
and the right of trial are the complements of each other,
through which a harsh prerogative is supposed to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
rounded into the proper form of civilized warfare. Therefore
every ship and cargo burned by the captors for the
reason that they had no port testifies that they are without
that vital sovereignty on the ocean which is needed
in the exercise of belligerent jurisdiction, and that they
are not <i>ocean</i> belligerents <i>in fact</i>. Nay, more, all these
bonfires of the sea cry out against the power which
by precipitate concession furnished the torch. As well
invest the rebel rajahs of India, who never tasted salt
water, with this ocean prerogative, so that they too may
rob and burn; as well constitute land-locked Poland,
now in arms for independence, an ocean belligerent,&mdash;or
enroll mountain Switzerland in the same class,&mdash;or
join with Shakespeare in giving to inland Bohemia an
outlook upon the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>To aggravate this concession, the ships are all built,
rigged, armed, and manned in Great Britain. It is out of
British oak and British iron that they are constructed,
rigged with British ropes, made formidable with British
arms, provided with British gunners, and navigated by
British crews, so as to constitute in all respects a <i>British
naval expedition</i>. British ports supply the place of
Rebel Slavemonger ports. British ports are open to them,
when their own are closed. British ports constitute
their <i>naval base of operations and supplies</i>, furnishing
everything needful, except an officer, the ship’s papers,
and a court for the trial of the prizes, each of which is
essential to the legality of the expedition. And yet
these same ships, thus equipped in British ports, and
<i>never touching a port of the pretended government</i> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
whose name they rob and burn,&mdash;being simply a rib
taken out of the side of England and prostituted to
Rebel Slavery,&mdash;receive the further passport of belligerence
from the British Government, when <i>in fact</i> the
belligerence does not exist. The whole proceeding, from
the laying of the keel in a British dockyard to the
bursting flames on the ocean, is a mockery of International
Law and an insult to a friendly power.</p>

<p>The case is sometimes said to be new; but it is new
only as no such “parricide” is provided against in express
terms. It was not anticipated. But the principles
which govern it are as old as justice and humanity, in
the interests of which belligerent rights are said to be
conceded. Here it is all reversed, and it is now apparent,
that, whatever the motives of the British Government,
the concession was in behalf of <i>in</i>justice and <i>in</i>humanity.
Burning ships and scattered wrecks are the
witnesses. If such a case is not condemned by International
Law, then has this law lost its virtue. Call
such cruisers by whatever polite term most pleases the
ear, and you do not change their character with their
name. Without a home and without a legal character,
they are mere gypsies of the sea, disturbers of the
common highway, outlaws, and enemies of the human
race.</p>

<p>There is a precedent which shows how impossible it
is for a pretended power, without a single port, to possess
belligerent rights on the ocean, and how impossible
it is for the ship of such pretended power to be anything
but a felon ship. James the Second of England, after
he had ceased to be <i>de facto</i> king, and while an exile
without a single port, undertook to issue letters of
marque. It was argued unanswerably before the Privy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Council of William the Third, that a deposed prince
could not receive from any other sovereign “international
privileges”; “that, if he could grant a commission
to take the ships of a single nation, it would in
effect be a general license to plunder, <i>because those who
were so commissioned would be their own judges of whatever
they took</i>”; and “that the reason of the thing, which
pronounced that robbers and pirates, when they formed
themselves into a civil society, became just enemies, pronounced
also that a king without territory, without power
of protecting the innocent or punishing the guilty, <i>or
in any way of administering justice</i>, dwindled into a pirate,
if he issued commissions to seize the goods and
ships of nations, <i>and that they who took commissions
from him must be held by legal inference to have associated
‘sceleris causâ’ and could not be considered as
members of a civil society</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> These weighty words are
strictly applicable to the present case. Whatever the
force of Rebel Slavery on land, it is no more on the
ocean than the “deposed prince,” “without power of
protecting the innocent or punishing the guilty, <i>or in
any way of administering justice</i>”; and, like the prince,
it has “dwindled into a pirate,” except so far as sustained
by British concession. In adducing this precedent,
I follow the learned ex-Chancellor, Lord Chelmsford,
who used it to show, that, without the concession
of belligerent rights to our Rebels, “any Englishman
aiding them by fitting out a privateer against the Federal
Government would be guilty of piracy.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> But the
reasoning at the Privy Council shows, also, that the
concession ought not to have been made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>There is yet another British precedent, which shows
how essential are judicial proceedings before appropriation
of a captured ship or cargo. The case is memorable.
It is none other than that of the famous Captain
Kidd, who, on indictment for piracy, as long ago as
1701, produced a commission in justification. But it
was at once declared not enough to show a commission;
<i>he must also show condemnation of the captured ship</i>. The
Lord Chief Baron of that day said, that, “if he had acted
pursuant to his commission, <i>he ought to have condemned
the ship and goods</i>”; that “by his not condemning them
he seems to show his aim, mind, and intention; that he
did not act in that case by virtue of his commission,
but quite contrary to it, for he takes the ship and shares
the money and goods, and is taken in that very ship,
… <i>so that there is no color or pretence appears that he
intended to bring this ship to England to be condemned
or to have condemned it in any of the English plantations</i>”;
and that, “whilst men pursue their commissions,
they must be justified, but when they do things not authorized,
or never acted by them, <i>it is as if there had
been no commission at all</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Captain Kidd was condemned
to death and executed as a pirate. If he was
a pirate, worthy of death, then, by the same rule, those
rovers who rob cargoes, burn ships, and adorn their
cabins with rows of stolen chronometers, careless of a
Prize Court, are entitled to small favor from a civilized
power.</p>

<p>Without considering more critically what should be
the fate of these ocean incendiaries, or what the responsibilities
of England, out of whom they came, I content
myself with the conclusion that they are not entitled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<i>ocean</i> belligerence. And here let it be understood that
no question is possible with regard to an established
power with access to the ocean; for belligerent rights
are fixed by International Law, without foreign recognition;
nor can the rights of such a power be a precedent
for any concession to a rebel community without ports
and Prize Courts.</p>

<p><i>Pirate</i> is a hard word; but Jefferson did not shrink
from applying it to “private armed vessels,” infesting
our coasts, preying upon our commerce, and making
captures at the very entrance of our harbors, as well
as on the high seas. “They have carried them off,” he
says, “under pretence of legal adjudication; but, not daring
to approach a court of justice, they have plundered
and sunk them by the way, or in obscure places, where
no evidence could arise against them, maltreated the
crews, and abandoned them in boats in the open sea
or on desert shores without food or covering.” These
things, kindred to what is done by our Rebel cruisers,
he calls “enormities,” and he announces that he has
equipped a force “to bring the offenders in for trial
as <i>pirates</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Even if Rebel Slavery, coagulated in embryo government,
has arrived at that <i>semi</i>-sovereignty <i>de facto</i>
on the ocean which justifies belligerent rights, yet the
Christian powers should indignantly decline to make the
concession, because by doing so they make themselves
accomplices in shameful crime. Here I avoid details.
It is sufficient to say that every argument of fact and
reason, every whisper of conscience and humanity, every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
indignant outburst of an honest man against recognition
of Slavery as an independent power, is equally strong
against any concession of ocean belligerence. Such concession
is half-way house to recognition, and can be
made only where a nation is ready, if the fact of independence
be sufficiently established, to acknowledge
it, on the principle of Vattel, that “whosoever has a
right to the end has a right to the means.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> It is
equally clear, that, where a nation, on grounds of conscience,
must refuse recognition of independence, it cannot
concede belligerence; for, <i>where the end is forbidden,
the means must be forbidden also</i>. The illogical absurdity
of such concession by Great Britain, so persistent
always against Slavery, and now for more than a generation
the declared protectress of the African race,
becomes doubly apparent, when it is considered that
every Rebel ship built in England and invested with
ocean belligerence carries with it the Law of Slavery, so
that, by British concession, the ship becomes an <i>extension</i>
of <i>Slave</i> territory and a floating <i>Slave</i> castle.</p>

<p>And yet it is said that this impostor is entitled to
ocean rights, and the British Queen is made to proclaim
them. Sad day for England, when another wicked compromise
was struck with Slavery, kindred to that old
treaty which mantles the cheeks of honest Englishmen,
when the slave-trade was protected and its profits
secured to British subjects! I know not the profits
secured by the destruction of American commerce, but
I do know that the Treaty of Utrecht, crimson with the
blood of slaves, is not so crimson as that reckless proclamation
which gave to Slavery a frantic life, and helped
for a time, nay, still helps, this demon in the rage with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
which it battles against Human Rights. Such a ship,
with the law of Slavery on its deck and the flag of
Slavery at its mast-head, sailing for Slavery, fighting
for Slavery, burning for Slavery, and knowing no other
sovereignty than the pretended government of Rebel
Slavery, can be nothing less in spirit and character than
a slave pirate and the enemy of the human race. Like
produces like, and the parent power, which is Slavery,
must stamp itself upon the ship, making it a floating
offence to Heaven, with no limit to its audacity,&mdash;wild,
outrageous, impious, a monster of the deep, to
be hunted down by all who have not forgotten their
duty alike to God and man.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there is one simple act which the justice
of England cannot continue to refuse. That fatal concession,
made in a moment of eclipse, when reason and
humanity were obscured, must be annulled. The <i>blunder-crime</i>
must be renounced, so that Slave pirates may
no longer sail the sea, robbing, destroying, burning, with
British license. Then will they promptly disappear forever,
and with them the occasion of strife between two
great powers, who ought to be, if not as mother and
child, at least as brothers among the nations. And
may God in His mercy help this consummation!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here I leave this part of the subject, founding my
objections on two grounds.</p>

<p>(1.) The embryo of Rebel Slavery has not that degree
of sovereignty <i>on the ocean</i> which is essential to
belligerence there.</p>

<p>(2.) Even if it possessed the requisite sovereignty,
no Christian power can make such concession to it
without shameful complicity with Slavery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>Both are objections of <i>fact</i>. Either is sufficient. Even
if the belligerence seems to be established as <i>fact</i>, still
its concession in this age of Christian light must be
impossible, except under some temporary aberration,
which, for the honor of England and the welfare of
Humanity, should speedily pass away.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again, fellow-citizens, I crave forgiveness for this
long trespass. If the field traversed is ample, it has
been brightened always by the light of international
justice, exposing clearly, from beginning to end, the sacred
landmarks of duty. I have been frank, disguising
nothing and keeping nothing back, so that you have
been able to see the perils to which the Republic is
exposed from the natural tendency of war to breed
war, as exhibited in examples of history, and also from
the fatal proclivity of foreign powers to intermeddle,
as exhibited in recent instances of querulous criticism
or intrusive proposition, all adverse to the good cause,
while pirate ships are permitted to depredate on our
commerce; then how the best historic instances testify
in favor of Freedom, and how all intervention of every
kind, whether by proffer of mediation or otherwise,
becomes intolerable, when its influence tends to the
establishment of that soulless anomaly, a professed Republic
built on the hopeless and everlasting bondage
of a race; and especially how Great Britain is sacredly
engaged by all the logic of her history and all her
traditions in unbroken lineage against any such unutterable
baseness; then how all the Christian powers
constituting the Family of Nations are firmly bound to
set their faces against any recognition of the embryo
government.&mdash;first, because its independence is not <i>in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
fact</i> established, and, secondly, because, even if <i>in fact</i>
established, its recognition is impossible without criminal
complicity in Slavery; and, lastly, how these same
Christian powers are firmly bound by the same twofold
reasons against any concession of ocean rights to this
hideous pretender.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It only remains that the Republic should gird itself
to the majesty of its duties. War is terrible and hard to
bear, with its waste, its pains, its wounds, its funerals.
But in this war we are not choosers. We are challenged
to the defence of country, and in this sacred cause to
crush Slavery. There is no alternative. Slavery began
the combat, staking life, <i>and determined to rule or die</i>.
Let it die; and to this end the country must be aroused.
We need a song like “Scots who have with Wallace
bled.” The cause is greater now than then. We need
words like those of Luther, “half battles.” Ours is
another Reformation and another Revolution. The attempted
revolution for Slavery we meet by a counter
revolution for Liberty. That we may continue freemen,
there must be no slaves; and thus our own security is
linked with the redemption of a race. Blessed lot,
amidst the harshness of war, to wield the arms and deal
the blows under which the monster will surely fall!
The battle is mighty; for into Slavery has entered the
Spirit of Evil. It is persistent; for such a gathered
wickedness, concentrated, aroused, and maddened, must
have a tenacity of life which will not yield at once.
But no might nor time can save it now.</p>

<p>That the whole war is contained in Slavery may be
seen not only in the acts of the National Government,
but also in the confessions of Rebel Slavemongers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Already the President has proclaimed that the slaves
throughout the whole Rebel region “are and henceforward
shall be free”; and in order to fix the irreversible
character of this sublime edict, he has further announced
“that the Executive Government of the United States,
including the military and naval authorities thereof, will
recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.”<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
An enlightened commission is constituted to consider
how these thronging freedmen can be best employed for
their own good and the national defence. Already the
sons of Africa, as mustered soldiers of the Union, have
shown a discipline and a bravery not unworthy of their
ancient fathers, when the prophet Jeremiah said, “Let
the mighty men come forth, the Ethiopians and the Libyans
that handle the shield”;<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and still further, by
their stature, by their appearance in the ranks, and even
by the unexpected testimony of sanitary statistics, according
to which for every black soldier disabled by
sickness there are more than ten white, thus making
the army health of the black ten times as sure as that
of the white,&mdash;by all these things they have shown that
the Father of History, who is our earliest classical authority,
was not entirely mistaken, when he spoke of
Ethiopia as “the most distant region of the earth, whose
inhabitants are the tallest, most beautiful, and most long-lived
of the human race.”<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Even if these acts of the
National Government were less significant, all doubt is
removed by the Rebel Slavemongers themselves, who,
in Satanic audacity, openly avow that Slavery is the
end and aim of the government they seek to establish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
so that the whole bloody war they wage is all in the
name of Slavery. Therefore, in battling against the Rebellion,
we battle against Slavery. Freedom is the growing
inspiration of our armies and the just inscription of
our banners. Such a war is not a war of subjugation,
but a war of liberation, to save the Republic from a
petty oligarchy of taskmasters, and to rescue four millions
of human beings from cruel oppression. Not to
subjugate, but to liberate, is the object of our Holy
War.</p>

<p>And yet British statesmen, forgetting for the moment
all moral distinctions, forgetting God, who will not be
forgotten, gravely announce that our cause must fail.
Alas! individual wickedness is too often successful; but
a pretended nation, suckled in wickedness and boasting
its wickedness, a new Sodom, with all the guilt of the
old, waiting to be blasted, and yet, in barefaced effrontery,
openly seeking the fellowship of Christian powers,
is doomed to defeat. Toleration of such a pretension
is practical atheism. Chronology and geography are
both offended. Piety stands aghast. In this age of
light, and in countries boasting civilization, there can be
no place for its barbarous plenipotentiaries. As well
expect crocodiles crawling on the pavements of London
and Paris, or the carnivorous idols of Africa installed
for worship in Westminster Abbey and Notre Dame.</p>

<p>Even if the Republic were less strong, yet I am glad
to believe that the Rebellion must fail from the essential
impossibility of any such wicked success. The responsibilities
of the Christian powers would be increased
by our weakness. Behind our blockade there would be
<i>a moral blockade</i>; behind our armies there would be the
aroused judgment of the civilized world. But not on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
that account can we hesitate. This is no time to pause.
Thus do I, who formerly pleaded so often for Peace,
now insist upon Liberty as its indispensable condition,<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>&mdash;clearly
because, in this terrible moment, there is no
other way to that sincere and solid peace without which
is endless war. Even on economic grounds, it were better
that this war should proceed rather than recognize
any partition, which, beginning with humiliation, must
involve the perpetuation of armaments and break out
again in blood. But there is something worse than
waste of money; it is waste of character. Give me
any peace but a liberticide peace. In other days the
immense eloquence of Burke was stirred against a regicide
peace. But a peace founded on the killing of a
king is not so bad as a peace founded on the killing of
Liberty; nor can the saddest scenes of such a peace
be so sad as the daily life legalized by Slavery. A
queen on the scaffold is not so pitiful a sight as a
woman on the auction-block.</p>

<p>While thus steady in purpose at home, we must not
neglect that proper moderation abroad which becomes
the consciousness of strength and the nobleness of our
cause. The mistaken sympathy which foreign powers
bestow upon Slavery,&mdash;or, it may be, the mistaken
insensibility,&mdash;under the plausible name of “neutrality,”
which they profess, will be worse for them than
for us. For them it will be a record of shame, which
their children would gladly blot out with tears. For us
it will be only another obstacle vanquished in the battle
for Civilization, where, unhappily, false friends are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
mingled with open enemies. Even if the cause seem
for a while imperilled by foreign powers, yet our duties
are none the less urgent. If the pressure be great,
the resistance must be greater. Nor can there be any
retreat. Come weal or woe, this is the place for us to
stand.</p>

<p>I know not if a republic like ours can count even
now upon the certain friendship of any European power,
unless it be the Republic of William Tell. The very
name is unwelcome to the full-blown representatives of
monarchical Europe, who forget how proudly, even in
modern history, Venice bore the title of <i>Serenissima
Respublica</i>. It is for us to change all this. Our consistent
example will be enough. Thus far we have
been known chiefly through that vital force which Slavery
could only degrade, but not subdue. Now, at last,
by the death of Slavery, will the Republic begin to live.
For what is life without Liberty? Stretching from ocean
to ocean, teeming with population, bountiful in resources
of all kinds, rejoicing in that righteousness which exalteth
a nation, and thrice happy in universal enfranchisement,
it will be more than conqueror. Nothing too vast
for its power, nothing too minute for its care. Triumphant
over the foulest wrong ever inflicted, after the bloodiest
war ever waged, it will know the majesty of Right
and the beauty of Peace, prepared always to uphold the
one and to cultivate the other. Strong in its own mighty
stature, filled with all the fulness of a new life, and covered
with a panoply of renown, it will confess that no
dominion is of value that does not contribute to human
happiness. Born in this latter day and child of its own
struggles, without ancestral claim, but heir of all the
ages, it will stand forth to assert the dignity of man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and wherever any member of the Human Family can
be succored, there its voice will reach,&mdash;as the voice of
Cromwell reached across France, even to the persecuted
mountaineers of the Alps. Such will be this Republic,
upstart among the nations. Ay! as steam-engine, telegraph,
and chloroform are upstart. Comforter and helper
like these, it can know no bounds to its empire over
a willing world. But the first stage is the death of
Slavery.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>This speech was made at a crisis in our foreign relations when they
were watched with more than the wonted anxiety, which began with
the hasty concession of belligerent rights, as early as May 13, 1861.
Among painful incidents may be mentioned the affair of the Trent, with
the attendant menace, the escape of the Florida, and then of the Alabama,
the damage to our commerce by these British vessels, the report
of other vessels building for the Rebels, the swarm of British blockade-runners
with arms and powerful cannon, adverse speeches of British
statesmen, offensive articles of the British press, and movements for the
recognition of the Rebels as an independent power.</p>

<p>As early as March 4, 1861, Mr. Gregory gave notice in the House
of Commons that on an early day he would call the attention of her
Majesty’s Government to the expediency of a prompt recognition of
the Southern Confederacy of America. April 16, Mr. Gregory renewed
his notice, and added a call for papers. This motion was afterward
deferred from April 30 to May 13, and on May 16 until June 7, when
it was finally postponed <i>sine die</i>. After that frequent debates occurred
in both Houses of Parliament, involving the course of England to the
United States. As late as June 30, 1863, in the summer before Mr.
Sumner’s speech, a long debate was started in the House of Commons
by Mr. Roebuck, on presenting a petition praying the House to enter
into negotiations with the great powers of Europe with the object of
recognizing the independence of the Confederate States. To all these
things was now superadded the open construction at Birkenhead of
two powerful iron-clad war-vessels, known as the Rebel rams.</p>

<p>The country was alarmed, for the contribution of these powerful vessels
to the Rebel navy was felt to be an open participation in the
Rebellion. Foreign war seemed to menace. Mr. Sumner, in private
correspondence with England during the summer, did not hesitate to
say, that, in his judgment, the sailing of these Rebel rams from an
English port, after the ample notice given, would be equivalent to a
declaration of war by England, not unlike the seizure of the Spanish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>galleons or the bombardment of Copenhagen. Our diplomatic correspondence
shows a similar sentiment in important official quarters.
July 11, Mr. Adams, our minister at London, after setting forth “a
systematic plan of warfare upon the people of the United States carried
on from the port of Liverpool, as well as in less degree from other ports
in the kingdom,” called the attention of Earl Russell to “the construction
and equipment of a steam vessel of war of the most formidable kind
now known,” and intimated that such a proceeding would “be regarded
by the Government and people of the United States with the greatest
alarm, as virtually tantamount to a participation in the war by the
people of Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> At different times he transmitted additional
papers, showing the character of these vessels. Meanwhile one
iron-clad ram, being launched, received her engines, and was engaged
in receiving her coal, ready to depart, when, September 4, Mr. Adams,
transmitting further testimony, begged permission to record, in the
name of his Government, “this last solemn protest against the commission
of such an act of hostility against a friendly nation.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> On
the same day he received a communication from Earl Russell, bearing
date September 1, where, after setting forth the alleged insufficiency
of the testimony against the vessels, he says: “Her Majesty’s
Government are advised that they cannot interfere in any way with
these vessels.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The next day Mr. Adams replied: “I trust I need
not express how profound is my regret at the conclusion to which her
Majesty’s Government have arrived.… It would be superfluous in
me to point out to your Lordship that this is war. No matter what
may be the theory adopted of neutrality in a struggle, when this process
is carried on, in the manner indicated, from a territory and with
the aid of the subjects of a third party, that third party, to all intents
and purposes, ceases to be neutral. Neither is it necessary to show
that any government which suffers it to be done fails in enforcing the
essential conditions of international amity towards the country against
whom the hostility is directed.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> On the very day of this reply, Mr.
Seward, at Washington, addressed Mr. Adams as follows: “Can the
British Government suppose for a moment that such an assault as
is thus meditated can be made upon us by British built, armed, and
manned vessels, without at once arousing the whole nation and making
a retaliatory war inevitable?… For the interest of both countries,
and of civilization, I hope they will not let a blow fall from under their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>hands that will render peace impossible.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> Mr. Beaman, in his essay
on the Alabama Claims, after examining this correspondence, says,
it “shows, that, if these rams had been allowed to escape, peace between
Great Britain and the United States would have been no longer
possible.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>It is easy to see that the two countries were on the verge of war.
Happily, this was avoided by a tardy act, made known to Mr. Adams
by a note, under date of September 8: “Lord Russell presents his compliments
to Mr. Adams, and has the honor to inform him that instructions
have been issued which will prevent the departure of the two
iron-clad vessels from Liverpool.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> The Rebel rams were stopped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Sumner had accepted an invitation to speak in New
York on our foreign relations, at a time to be fixed by himself. Watching
the course of events, and seeing clearly the alternative that
presented itself to Mr. Adams and Mr. Seward, he wrote at the
close of August, fixing September 10th for his speech; and here his
purpose was twofold. Anxious to arrest the fatal tendency, he was
not without hope that he might obtain a hearing in England, especially
from the Cabinet, to most of whom he was personally known; but, if
unsuccessful in this last frank effort for peace, then he trusted that his
speech would be a vindication of his country on the issue forced by
England, and an appeal to the moral sentiments of the civilized world.
On this account he dwelt especially on Slavery, and the impossibility
in a civilized age of recognizing a <i>new</i> power openly proclaiming this
Barbarism as its corner-stone.</p>

<p>The reception of this speech at home was cordial and sympathetic;
in England it was the reverse, although there were friendly exceptions.
A few extracts from the American press will show the unison with Mr.
Sumner, which becomes important in illustrating his position, and also
the divergence of sentiment in the two countries.</p>

<p>The New York press was outspoken.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <i>Herald</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The very voluminous speech of Mr. Senator Sumner at the Cooper Institute,
the other evening, in two or three points is a remarkable production.
His exposure and denunciations of the hypocritical pleadings and false pretences
of the British Government, in justification of its sneaking and perfidious
neutrality in this war, are well administered, and, considering the rapidly
dissolving Davis Confederacy, these views of the learned Senator at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>time can hardly fail to make a decided sensation, not only upon the public
mind of England, but upon the rhinoceros hides of the British Cabinet.…</p>

<p>“But the whole of this exhaustive and exhausting discourse of the inexhaustible
Senator is spoiled by his venomous and rabid denunciations of
African Slavery. In view of this peculiar Southern institution he becomes
as fierce and remorseless as a vicious bull, when a piece of red flannel is
flaunted before his eyes.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Times</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We give up one half of the entire surface of to-day’s issue of the <i>Times</i>
to the important speech upon our Foreign Relations delivered by Senator
Sumner in this city last night. The subject at the present moment is one of
such deep public interest, and of such overshadowing national importance,
that we believe we cannot do a greater service than by giving in full the
views of one who, by his official position as Chairman of the Senate Committee
on Foreign Affairs, by his relations with some of the foremost publicists
of England and France, and by his intimate knowledge of the whole
subject, is capable of speaking with intelligence, if not with authority.</p>

<p>“We can give no analysis or estimate of the discourse at this moment, as
it was a late hour of the night before he concluded its delivery; but every
intelligent citizen will doubtless give due study to its views and statements,
which, we need not say, are set forth in a style highly ornate, yet lucid, and
distinguished by all the characteristics of a professed orator.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Evening Post</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a very important subject, treated by him with great ability and
knowledge, and in a manner which must leave little to be added by the diligence
of others. It was listened to with profound attention and frequent
expressions of interest and approbation by one of the most closely packed
audiences which the hall at Cooper Institute ever contained.”</p>

</div>

<p>Horace Greeley, in a contribution to the <i>Independent</i>, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s speech is not, therefore, a mere rehearsal and arraignment
of national wrongs already endured. It is a protest and a warning against
those which are imminently threatened. In showing how deeply, flagrantly,
France and England have already sinned against us, he admonishes them
against persistence in the evil course on which they have entered, against
aggravating beyond endurance the indignities and outrages they have already
heaped upon us.… Mr. Sumner’s is the authentic voice, not of the mob,
but of the people. He utters the sentiments of the conscientious, the intelligent,
the peace-loving. His inoffensive protest against the wrongs to which
we have been subjected is utterly devoid of swagger or menace. It is a
simple, but most cogent demonstration, by the application thereto of the
established principles of International Law, of the systematic injustice to
which we as a people have been subjected. A miracle of historical and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>statesmanlike erudition, his address is severe without being harsh,&mdash;an
indictment judicial in its calmness, its candor, its resistless cogency.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Journal</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We trust no one will be deterred by its length from reading Mr. Sumner’s
speech on our Foreign Relations; and we are sure that no one will
be, who fairly enters upon the subject.… The speech is the most able
and elaborate ever delivered by Mr. Sumner, and will be read with great
interest abroad as well as in this country. Let us hope that it will help
to open the eyes of the people of England and France to the treachery of
their rulers to the progress of civilization and the spirit of the age.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, in another article, the same journal said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The recent speech of Mr. Sumner meets with the warmest expressions
of commendation from all quarters, excepting, of course, the journals which
are wedded to the interests of Slavery.… The speech was, in fact, timely,
and, while it was designed primarily to communicate facts of the gravest
interest to the people of the loyal States, it will have the secondary and not
less important effect of making an impression upon the Cabinets of England
and France. The fairness, candor, earnestness, and ability with which
great questions of international rights are discussed by a statesman so well
known abroad and so much respected as Mr. Sumner must secure for the
speech an attentive perusal by those who shape public opinion in the Old
World.”</p>

</div>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Boston Journal</i>, calling himself “An European
Democrat,” wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speech of Senator Sumner at the Cooper Institute will produce a
startling effect in Europe. It may safely be asserted that the opinions of that
gentleman upon international politics are received with greater favor in
England and France than those of perhaps any other American statesman.
He is regarded as most liberal and cosmopolitan in his views; his acquaintance
with leading public men in both countries is known to be alike extended
and intimate; and such declarations, therefore, as those to which he
gave utterance last Thursday evening will necessarily have extraordinary
weight in political and commercial circles.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Transcript</i>, of Boston, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The great speech of Senator Sumner upon the Foreign Relations of the
United States will command the attention of all intelligent men in Europe
and America. It is a thorough and exhaustive discussion of English and
French diplomacy, so far as either bears upon the present war. The effect
of the complete exposition of the policy of Great Britain with regard to Slavery
since 1807, proving, by clear and irrefragable historical instances, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>apostasy of the existing ministry to the high principles so long maintained,
must be great among all reflective Englishmen.… Mr. Sumner’s comprehensive
views of International Law, the extensive learning with which he
enriches the discussion of it, his convincing logic and kindling eloquence,
together with the results he reaches, make this address one of great importance,
and cannot but exert the most beneficial influence in this country
and in Europe.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Independent</i>, of New York, in a leading article entitled “Sumner
and Burke,” presented an elaborate parallel between the recent
speech and that against Warren Hastings.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The trial of Hastings was really a trial of England herself. So Burke
evidently felt it. The bill of charges and the speech upon them was more
of an appeal against the rulers of England than the despot of India.…
As he arraigned England against herself, so does Sumner. As he sought
to flatter her to the right by appeals to her highest professions and practices
against the swift current of her ruling passions and purposes, so does Sumner.
As he failed in his attempt, so, we fear, will Sumner.… Grander is
his position, as well as his appeal, than those of Burke. He stood before
a House of British nobles: Sumner stands before the Congress of Nations.
Burke impeached the conduct of a satrap: Sumner the heads of powerful
nations. Burke denounced him in the name of justice and law outraged by
his abuse of subject provinces: Sumner denounces England in the interests
of outraged internationality and humanity, for her conduct toward a free
and equal nation engaged in casting out the devils that Britain’s lust of gold
and power had forced upon her in the days of her helplessness. He has constrained
the haughty powers to appear at the bar of the Nations. The world
will hear his plea, and give him the verdict.”</p>

<p><i>Zion’s Herald</i>, of Boston, an able religious journal, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This speech is not hostile in its tone, unless our transatlantic friends
see fit to make it so. It is a grand effort in behalf of those principles which
are to underlie our renovated nationality; it is a noble assertion of our rights
against wrongs which are emphatically condemned by the best minds of
England and France themselves. If our sister nations will heed this appeal,
and cease to give the support hitherto accorded to our foes, it is not too late
for them to gain thereby the friendship of our people and the praise of mankind;
but if any European power should now directly espouse the cause of
the Rebellion, the responsibility of war will rest with them and not with us;
and even if they continue to grant the Rebels their sympathy and moral
support, the severe words of Mr. Sumner will be but a faint expression of
the infamy to which an indignant posterity will consign them.”</p>

<p>“The whole country owes Mr. Sumner a debt of gratitude for this timely,
thorough, and weighty exposition of our Foreign Relations. Its facts and
arguments must produce a strong impression upon the popular mind in England;
and every American who has friends abroad should hasten to put in
circulation in Great Britain as many copies of the speech as he can command.
Its tone, at once dignified, firm, and conciliatory, will help our cause
wherever it is read, while it cannot fail to ally to us all who really value
truth and honor between nations, and who abhor Slavery and its abettors.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Numerous letters, in harmony with the press of the country, attested
the extent to which Mr. Sumner was sustained, being spontaneous testimony
to the prevailing sentiment. Written as they were for the
purpose of sympathy and encouragement, they show the general conscience
and intelligence. Prompted by the speech, and relating exclusively
to it, they may be considered among its incidents. The warm
appreciation of Mr. Sumner’s service was less important than the aspiration
for country and for mankind which they disclosed.</p>

<p>“I have read it with great attention, and with the highest pleasure, for
the principles it announces, the facts it narrates, and the firm and manly

American people to the important fact, that, in all its disguises, English and

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s late speech in New York has arrived here in the journals,

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I returned from Washington this morning. Have read your speech with

than ever before.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The speech had a different reception in England, being criticized by
the press, and by Earl Russell in a public speech.</p>

<p>The New York correspondent of the London <i>Standard</i> called Mr.
Sumner “the mouthpiece of the President,” and said that the speech
“had been carefully examined by the President, and was analyzed by
the confidential members of the Cabinet, before being let off to the public
in this great city.” This was a mistake. Neither the President
nor any of his Cabinet had seen a line of the speech.</p>

<p>Its delivery was reported by the London <i>Times</i> of September 22d, in
a telegraphic despatch from Greencastle, in Ireland:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He denounced the conduct of the British Government in permitting the
building of war steamers in British ports for the Confederates and recognizing
on the part of the South any belligerent rights upon the ocean. He disbelieved
that either France or England would intervene in favor of a state
that based itself upon Negro Slavery, and asserted that all intervention in
the internal affairs of another nation was contrary to law and reason, unless
such intervention were obviously on the side of human rights.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Times</i> followed with an elaborate leader, undertaking to correct
statements of law and fact, dwelling especially on the allegation, that,
without the concession of belligerent rights, the supply of munitions
of war to rebels would have been a violation of English law. Here Mr.
Sumner had the authority of the English Law Lords in Parliament,
openly declaring that without such concession the building of a Rebel
ship in England would have been under the penalties of piracy, and it
is difficult to see why a corresponding penalty would not have followed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>the supply of munitions of war. In each case the article is supplied for
offence against a friendly power. Sir George Cornewall Lewis, remarkable
for learning and good sense, has said: “The law of England recognizes
the principle of protecting a foreign government by its own municipal
regulations”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>; and he refers to the trials for libels on foreign
sovereigns, and also to the proceedings in 1858 against Simon Bernard,
the Frenchman, indicted for a plot to assassinate the Emperor Louis
Napoleon, in supplying the grenades used by Orsini in his attempt. In
the latter case, Lord Chief Justice Campbell said to the jury: “If you
believe that he, as there is strong evidence to show, being acquainted
with Allsop’s views, and knowing that Allsop had got these grenades,
<i>assisted in having them, transported to Brussels,&mdash;if you believe that he
bought in this country the materials for making the fulminating powder
with which these grenades were charged</i>,&mdash;if you believe, that, living in
this country, and owing a temporary allegiance to the sovereign of this
country, <i>he sent over the revolvers</i> with the view that they should be
used in the plot against the Emperor of the French, … it will be a
fair inference, I think, to draw, that he had a guilty knowledge of that
plot.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Though this judgment was in the case of a conspiracy to take
the life of a foreign sovereign, it is not easy to see why the same principle
is not applicable to a conspiracy against a friendly power. To
this case may be added the authority of Lord Lyndhurst, who laid it
down in debate, with the concurrence of other Law Lords, that a conspiracy
in the United Kingdom, either by native subjects or aliens, to
do any act, either at home or abroad, tending to embroil the Government
with that of any foreign country, is a misdemeanor.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Is a rebellion
without belligerent rights different from a conspiracy? Its nature
was changed by the Queen’s Proclamation, which not only helped the
Rebels, but created a new set of customers.</p>

<p>The character of the leader in the <i>Times</i> appears in its conclusion:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We believe our readers have by this time had enough of the logic of Mr.
Sumner. It is based neither on law nor on fact, but upon his own sympathies
and antipathies, which he is pleased to assume must also be ours, on
the supposition, which we do not admit, that the North are obviously in the
right, and on the inference, which we refuse to draw, that, even if the North
are in the right, we are bound to violate the laws of neutrality in order to
assist them.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Daily News</i>, of London, in its first notice, said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He spoke under the impression that the English Government was about
to permit the Confederate iron-clads to leave this country, and he interpreted
their previous policy by this supposed breach of neutrality. Every
candid man will make allowance for words spoken under provocation, and
distinguish them from the utterances of settled malevolence, such as we were
accustomed to hear from the American statesmen now at Richmond, and
still hear from their allies in the Northern States.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a second article, the same journal criticized the speech at length,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a strange delusion. It makes one wonder whether it is still possible
that a republican legislator, now blinded by panic and perplexed by
jealousy, should even yet recover his sense and temper, and see the case
as others see it.… Instead of using his influence, as the friend of many
Englishmen, to bring the two peoples to a clear understanding, and the calm
temper which arises out of it, he has nourished and propagated a delusion,
and has applied all his powers of influence and eloquence to raise and kindle
the passions of his countrymen against a nation which, if not accustomed
to flatter, is capable of a sound and durable friendship with a people exhibiting
such qualities as the citizens of the Free States are manifesting now.
The American people have nothing to fear from us, while they treat us
justly. We believe that Mr. Sumner knows this as well as we do, however
he may be for the hour beguiled into passion and error.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Scotsman</i>, of Edinburgh, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The splendid oration which he delivered at New York on the 10th inst.,
though full of a strange injustice towards ourselves, ought not to lessen our
love for the man, and will increase our admiration of the orator and philanthropist;
but, if there was any idea that Mr. Sumner could reason clearly as
well as feel rightly and speak eloquently, that idea will be dissipated. All
the multitude of eloquent and burning words which he pours forth against
Slavery will here find ready echo; and even when he enters on accusations
against this country, as having ‘intermeddled on the side of Slavery,’
it will be felt that he speaks in the spirit, not of a mean and jealous enemy,
but of a high-minded, though mistaken friend. But no non-American man
can fail to perceive that there is a grand mistake lying at the root of all the
complaints he makes against us: he would have Great Britain in her national
capacity to deal with American affairs according to moral sentiments as distinguished
from political rules, and he condemns her for doing what he did
himself and is doing still.… He tries, indeed, to make a difference between
the hypothetical Confederate States and all other Slave States, including the
late United States. They will, he says, form a ‘<i>new</i>’ Slave Power. He
forgets, that, though the Power may be new, the Slavery will be old.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Manchester <i>Guardian</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We receive by the last steamer from New York the report of a speech
recently delivered by a person of great consideration in the councils of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>present Government at Washington, who maintains that the favor already
given to the Confederacy by England deserves the execration of humanity,
and supplies, if necessary, abundant cause for war. The speaker to whom
we allude is Mr. Charles Sumner, the President of the Committee of the
Senate on Foreign Affairs. He denounced, we are told, as ‘a betrayal of
civilization,’ England’s recognition of the Confederate States as belligerents,
and her proclamation of neutrality. <i>The absurd injustice of this often
repeated complaint is sufficiently shown by the simple observation, that,
in recognizing the belligerent rights of the South, we did exactly what the
Federal Government itself did</i>, and has continued to do from the commencement
of the war. We did, moreover, what no power could have avoided,
without absolutely intending to take a direct part in the subjugation of the
seceding States. But Mr. Sumner correctly appreciates the consequences
of this course, as adopted by ourselves and France, in perceiving that it insured
to the South the free exercise of all the power of making war from
its own resources which an independent state could possess.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Economist</i>, of London, a weekly journal, in an article entitled
“Mr. Sumner’s Speech at New York,” among many remarks of bad
temper and doubtful candor, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Charles Sumner has been delivering a speech before a crowded
audience in New York which will cause much pain and disappointment
to all friends and well-wishers of the Federal United States. It is weak in
argument, unfair and unjust in its representations, and bitter in tone and
temper. If men of Mr. Sumner’s education and position in America really
believe the things they say and indulge the feelings to which they give utterance,
it is clearly hopeless to attempt either to enlighten their understanding
or to allay their irritation.…</p>

<p>“Two other considerations will fully justify us in describing Mr. Sumner’s
address as marked by the most distinctly unfair and unfriendly <i>animus</i>
toward this country. The first is, that he has carefully avoided doing
the slightest justice to the strong Antislavery feeling which prevails
among us, and even insinuates a disposition to favor the slave empire of
the South.…</p>

<p>“Finally, what construction is to be placed upon the remarkable circumstance,
that, throughout his whole address, while endeavoring to rouse the
wrath of his countrymen by a vicious enumeration of the supposed offences
of Great Britain, he says not a word against France, which has participated
in nearly all, and added others of her own? He charges us with hostile
designs, because we recognized belligerent rights in the Confederates; but
he utters no word of complaint against France, who recognized these at the
same date and in the same terms.”</p>

</div>

<p>Referring to Mr. Sumner’s speech, it will be seen how untrue is the
statement that he said “not a word against France”; nor is it true
that he was unjust to “the strong Antislavery feeling” which had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>done so much honor to English history, although he lamented that it
was impotent to save England from fatal concession to Rebel Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a critical spirit in the provincial press. The Halifax
<i>Reporter</i>, in Nova Scotia, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner, whose judgment is evidently warped by his abhorrence of
Slavery, seems to expect that England should look upon the North as waging
the war on behalf of human liberty. It is obvious he considers, that, in
recognizing the Confederates as belligerents, her statesmen have exhibited
a sympathy with slaveholders which is unjustifiable.…</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner is peculiarly wrathy that any portion of the British people
should have been allowed to give aid and comfort to the Rebels by affording
them supplies of various kinds.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Globe</i>, at Toronto, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He reviews the whole transactions between England and the United
States since the commencement of the civil war with great warmth, beginning
with the proclamation of neutrality and ending with Mr. Laird’s rams,
and tortures every action of the British Government into a manifestation of
unfriendliness towards the Republic. We expected from Mr. Sumner more
enlightened consideration for the circumstances in which the English people
have been placed, and some acknowledgment of the provocation they have
received from this side of the Atlantic.…</p>

<p>“There is only one excuse for Mr. Sumner. As an Abolitionist, he has
been accustomed to look to England for sympathy and aid, and he is disappointed
to find so many enemies where he supposed he would see none but
friends. This feeling should not prevent him, however, from doing justice
as a publicist, nor, as a statesman, from pursuing the course most wise and
expedient at the moment.”</p>

</div>

<p>In a different tone, the <i>Morning Star</i>, of London, the constant friend
of the national cause, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Hon. Charles Sumner has not belied the confidence inspired by a
long and illustrious career. He is as firmly as ever the friend of peace, and
especially of peace between Great Britain and America. The eloquent voice
which has so often employed the stores of a richly furnished mind in persuasives
to international amity has not, as the telegrams suggested, been
inflamed by the heat of domestic conflict to the diffusion of discord between
kindred peoples. His speech at New York on the 10th of September is,
indeed, heavy with charges against France and England. But it is an appeal
for justice, not an incentive to strife. It is a complaint of hopes disappointed,
of friendship withheld, of errors hastily adopted and obstinately maintained.
It is, however, an argument which does honor even to those against
whom it is urged, and which aims to establish future relations of the closest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>alliance. Senator Sumner’s chief reproach is this,&mdash;that we have acted
unworthily of ourselves, unfaithfully to our deepest convictions and best
memories.…</p>

<p>“There runs through the whole of Mr. Sumner’s gigantic oration&mdash;far
too long to have been spoken as printed, but yet without a word of superfluous
argument or declamation&mdash;an idea on which we can now only touch.
From the first sentence to the last, Slavery is present to his mind. It colors
all his reasoning. It inspires him to prodigious eloquence. Not merely as
the Senator for Massachusetts, the honored chieftain of the political Abolitionists,
but as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, he sees
everywhere the presence of the Slave Power. Against it he invokes, in periods
of classic beauty and of fervid strength, all the moral forces of the mother
country. To England he makes a passionate and pathetic appeal&mdash;more
for her own sake than that of the slave, more for the sake of the future
than of present effects&mdash;that she withdraw all favor and succor from Rebel
slave-owners.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Northern Whig</i>, of Belfast, Ireland, noticed especially the statement
on <i>ocean</i> belligerence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One point, however, on which Mr. Sumner dwells, is of such urgent
present importance as to make the reproduction of his remarks, at such
length as our space allows, desirable. We refer to his criticism of the claims
of the Confederates to belligerent rights <i>at sea</i>. Whether the ground which
Mr. Sumner takes on this question be or be not tenable, whether the authorities
and examples by which he supports it really make out his case, is a
matter not to be decided summarily. His argument is, beyond dispute, a
most masterly one, and deserves the careful attention of the English Government
and its legal advisers, and will, no doubt, engage the ingenuity of
writers upon International Law.”</p>

</div>

<p>These expressions of opinion show something of the extent to which
Mr. Sumner was sustained, and also the British criticism he encountered.
To the latter must be added an unexpected episode.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Earl Russell was on a visit to Scotland when Mr. Sumner’s speech
arrived. Being entertained at a public dinner in the Town-Hall of
Blairgowrie, September 26th, he took that occasion to review the questions
of the war, and especially to answer Mr. Sumner, thus making
a new precedent. It is not known that any European statesman ever
before made a speech criticizing a speech in another country. The part
relating to us was approached by the remark, “I am speaking of what
has occurred in what a few years ago were the United States of America”;
and then, towards the end, he says, “The people of what were
the United States, whether they are called Federals or Confederates.”</p>

<p>The following passages belong to this answer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was impossible to look on the uprising of a community of five million
people as a mere petty insurrection [‘<i>Hear! hear!</i>’], or as not having the
rights which at all times are given to those who, by their numbers and
importance, or by the extent of the territory they possess, are entitled to
these rights. [<i>Cheers.</i>] Well, it was said we ought not to have done that,
because they were a community of Slaveholders.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, I trust that our abhorrence of Slavery is not in the least
abated or diminished. [<i>Loud and prolonged cheers.</i>] For my own part, I
consider it one of the most horrible crimes that yet disgrace humanity.
[<i>Cheers.</i>] But then, when we are treating of the relations which we bear to
a community of men, I doubt whether it would be expedient or useful for
humanity that we should introduce that new element of declaring that <i>we
will have no relations with a people who permit Slavery to exist among them.
We have never adopted it yet, we have not adopted it in the case of Spain or
Brazil, and I do not believe that the cause of humanity would be served by our
adoption of it.</i> [‘<i>Hear! hear!</i>’]</p>

<p>“Well, then it was said that these Confederate States were Rebels,&mdash;Rebels
against the Union. Perhaps, Gentlemen, I am not so nice as I
ought to be on the subject. But I recollect that we rebelled against Charles
the First [<i>a laugh</i>], we rebelled against James the Second, and the people
of New England, not content with these two rebellions, rebelled against
George the Third. [<i>‘Hear!’ and laughter.</i>] … But, certainly, if I look
to the declarations of those New England orators,&mdash;and I have been reading
lately, if not the whole, yet a very great part, of the very long speech
by Mr. Sumner on the subject, delivered at New York,&mdash;I own, I cannot
but wonder to see these men, the offspring, as it were, of three rebellions,
as we are the offspring of two rebellions, really speaking, like the Czar of
Russia, the Sultan of Turkey, or Louis the Fourteenth himself, of the dreadful
crime and guilt of rebellion. [<i>Loud laughter and cheers.</i>] …</p>

<p>“I said, that in America, although there were some of the local courts
which had not the authority of such men as Lord Stowell and Sir William
Grant, yet there was a Court of Appeal, there was a Supreme Court, in the
United States, which contained, and had for many years contained, men as
learned and of as high reputation in the law and of as unsullied reputation
for integrity as any that have sat in our English courts of justice, and that we
ought to wait patiently for the decision of those tribunals. Now what is my
surprise to find, and what would be your surprise to find, that Mr. Sumner
is so prejudiced that he brings these declarations of mine against me, saying
<i>that I have diminished the reputation of the American Courts</i>, and that I
showed myself biased against the Federal States, by the declaration I then
made in Parliament! [<i>A gentleman from the Southern States among the
company here ejaculated, ‘He is not to be believed.’</i>]</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
<p>“I will not detain you further on these subjects; but one remark I must
make on the general tendency of these speeches and writings in America.
The Government of America discusses these matters very fairly with the
English Government. Sometimes we think them quite in the wrong; sometimes
they say we are quite in the wrong; but we discuss them fairly, and
with regard to the Secretary of State I see no complaint to make. I think
he weighs the disadvantages and difficulties of our situation in a very fair
and equal balance. But there are others, and Mr. Sumner is one of them,
his speech being an epitome almost of all that has been contained in the
American press, by whom our conduct is very differently judged.”</p>

</div>

<p>In defending the concession of belligerent rights to Rebel Slavery,
Earl Russell forgot two things: first, that the Rebels, whatever their
numbers, were without ports or Prize Courts, and therefore unable to
administer justice on the ocean, which was essential to the protection
of neutrals, and, in the nature of things, the condition precedent of any
such concession; and, secondly, he forgot, that, whatever might be the
traditional relations with existing nations “permitting Slavery to exist
among them,” it was now proposed, for the first time in history, to recognize
a rebel community seeking to found a new nation whose declared
corner-stone was Slavery, which Mr. Sumner insisted was contrary to
good morals and the Antislavery principles so constantly and loftily
avowed by England.</p>

<p>On another occasion Earl Russell seems to have laid down a rule
requiring Prize Courts, as will be seen in Mr. Sumner’s speech.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> He
insisted that vessels seized should be tried in a Prize Court. If this
rule is correct, how vindicate the award of belligerent rights to a community
without Prize Courts? Another question may also be asked:
If Slavery be, as Earl Russell declared, “one of the most horrible
crimes that yet disgrace humanity,” how could England make any
concession to Rebels whose single declared object of separate existence
was this very crime?</p>

<p>The answer to Mr. Sumner on Prize Courts will be appreciated after
reading the report in the London <i>Times</i>, June 16, 1863,<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> of what Earl
Russell actually said in the House of Lords.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With regard to the decisions in Prize Courts, I must say I lament that
the Constitution of the United States is such, that, instead of being brought
at once before the Court of Admiralty, where generally you have a very
eminent judge to preside, perfectly well acquainted with the Law of Nations,
<i>such cases go in the first instance before the District Courts</i>, then, I think, before
a Circuit Court, and it is only after a considerable delay that they come
before the Supreme Court of the United States. I say this, because I believe
we should all very much respect a decision of the Supreme Court of the
United States, and it is to be lamented that there should be a considerable
delay before the judgment of that tribunal can be obtained.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The compliment to the Supreme Court of the United States, which,
like the House of Lords and the Privy Council, is not a court of original
jurisdiction in prize cases, will hardly excuse the reflection upon
the District Courts, which are the Admiralty Courts of the United
States,&mdash;especially when it is considered that those at Boston and New
York, where the prize cases chiefly occurred, were administered at the
time by judges who would compare favorably with the contemporary
judge of the English Admiralty. Judge Sprague, of Boston, and Judge
Betts, of New York, were “very eminent” and “perfectly well acquainted
with the Law of Nations,” although only judges of District
Courts.</p>

<p>The speech of Earl Russell was noticed by Mr. Adams, in a despatch
to Mr. Seward, under date of October 1, 1863:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The event of the week has been the speech of Earl Russell at Blairgowrie,
evidently drawn forth by the report of Mr. Sumner’s address at New
York.”<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It was the subject of comment by the press of England and the
United States. The sympathetic <i>Morning Star</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s oration has had an unexpected effect. It has stirred the
phlegmatic nature of Earl Russell. The Foreign Secretary has replied from
his Scottish retreat to the complaints and reproaches of the New England
Senator. Absurdly contemptuous in his personal allusions to the distinguished
Senator, Lord Russell confesses the force of his accusations by taking
the trouble to reply to them.…</p>

<p>“It would also have been well, if our Foreign Secretary had included in
his reply some notice of one of the most distinct and gravest of Mr. Sumner’s
complaints. The defence of our recognition of the Confederates as belligerents
is without novelty. It is a simple repetition of the old statement, that
our naval commanders required to be instructed whether they should respect
the new flag or treat it as that of a pirate. Lord Russell does not touch the
objection raised by Mr. Sumner, that the Confederates had no ocean navy,
and could provide one only from neutral ports. Neither does his Lordship
explain why the resolution to recognize the Confederates as belligerents was
taken in the absence from this country of a Federal minister.</p>

<p>“But, notwithstanding these defects, Lord Russell’s speech at Blairgowrie
is an immense advance upon his previous utterances on the American Question.
It is evident that he begins to perceive the real issue of the conflict,
and rightly estimates the direction of British sentiment.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Boston <i>Traveller</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Earl Russell has fallen into several grave errors in the course of his remarks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>He has utterly misconceived the whole temper of Mr. Sumner’s
speech, when he says that ‘it weighs the difficulties of the English Government
in an unequal balance,’ and that it is ‘an epitome of almost all that
has been contained by the press of America’ on the subject of the ill-feeling
against Great Britain and her neutrality, so generally prevalent among us.
The feeling evoked by the belligerent articles of the New York <i>Herald</i> is one
of far different character from that produced by Mr. Sumner’s remarks.
Lord Russell charges him with injustice to the English people. Had he read
the speech to which he professes to reply with more care, there would have
been found no ground to sustain such a charge.”</p>

</div>

<p>In France the speech of Mr. Sumner was published in an abridged
form, under the following title:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Les Relations Extérieures des États-Unis. Préface et Traduction abrégée
par A. Malespine [of the <i>Opinion Nationale</i>]. Paris, 1863.” 31 pp. 8vo.</p>

</div>

<p>The eminent historian, Henri Martin, writing in the <i>Siècle</i> on American
affairs, alluded to the speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We will not close these considerations without recommending to the
readers of the <i>Siècle</i> the eloquent appeal addressed to public opinion by one
of the greatest citizens of the United States, Charles Sumner, Chairman of
the Committee of Foreign Relations in the American Senate. The French
translation of this discourse on the <i>Foreign Relations of the United States</i>
has just appeared. He treats here the question of foreign intervention in
fact and in right, demonstrates in a victorious manner, according to our
opinion, that the South had not the title to be admitted as a belligerent,
and considers it impossible that France and England can recognize a political
society founded on Slavery. We think to-day the cause gained. Neither
the sons of ’89 nor the country of Wilberforce will have this stain on their
history.”</p>

</div>

<p>These various testimonies at home and abroad, where criticism is not
wanting, show that Mr. Sumner did not speak in vain. Evidently he
obtained a hearing for the national cause.</p>

<h2><a name="OUR_DOMESTIC_RELATIONS_POWER_OF_CONGRESS" id="OUR_DOMESTIC_RELATIONS_POWER_OF_CONGRESS"></a>OUR DOMESTIC RELATIONS: POWER OF CONGRESS
OVER THE REBEL STATES.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Article in the Atlantic Monthly, October, 1863.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>This argument was prepared as a speech on the resolutions of February
11, 1862, entitled “State Rebellion State Suicide, Emancipation
and Reconstruction”; but the tardy success of our arms and the press
of business caused its postponement, until, during the recess of Congress,
it was thought best to print it as an article in the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>. It was much discussed. Hon. Montgomery Blair, at the
time a member of the Cabinet, in a speech at Rockville, Maryland,
October 3d, replied to it at length, insisting that it was “the keynote
of the revolution,”&mdash;“the programme of the movement,”&mdash;presenting
“the issue on which the Abolition party has resolved to rest
its hopes of setting up its domination in this country”; and in opposition
to this “programme” he placed “that which is presented by
President Lincoln,” alleging that Mr. Sumner had directly arrayed
himself against the President on a question of fundamental policy in
the conduct of the war. The <i>National Intelligencer</i>, at Washington, in
an elaborate leader, sustained the position of Mr. Blair.</p>

<p>From this time forward, the discussion proceeded in the press, in
public meetings, and in Congress, followed by the measures of Reconstruction,
including especially the requirement by Congress of the colored
suffrage in the reorganization of the Rebels and in their new
Constitutions,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> all of which assumed the power of Congress.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">At this moment our domestic relations all hinge upon
one question,&mdash;How to treat the Rebel States.
No patriot citizen doubts the triumph of our arms in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
the suppression of the Rebellion. Early or late triumph
is inevitable,&mdash;perhaps by sudden collapse of the bloody
imposture, or perhaps by slower and more gradual surrender.
For ourselves, we are prepared for either alternative,
and shall not be disappointed, if constrained to
wait yet a little longer; but when the day of triumph
comes, political duties will take the place of military.
The victory won by our soldiers must be assured by
wise counsels, so that its hard-earned fruits shall not
be lost.</p>

<p>The relations of the States to the National Government
must be carefully considered,&mdash;not too boldly,
not too timidly,&mdash;that we may understand in what
way or by what process <i>the transition from Rebel forms
may be most surely accomplished</i>. If I do not greatly err,
it will be found that the powers of Congress, thus far so
effective in raising armies and supplying moneys, will
be important, if not essential, in fixing the conditions
of perpetual peace. But there is one point on which
there can be no question. The dogma and delusion of
State Rights, as mischievously interpreted, which did
so much for the Rebellion, must not be allowed to neutralize
all that our arms have gained.</p>

<p>Already, in a remarkable instance, the President has
treated the pretension of State Rights with proper indifference.
Quietly and without much discussion, he has
constituted military governments in the Rebel States,
with governors nominated by himself: all of which testifies
against the old delusion. Strange will it be, if this
extraordinary power, amply conceded to the President,
is denied to Congress. Practically, the whole question
is opened here. Therefore to this aspect of it I ask your
first attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>Already four military governors have been appointed:
one for Tennessee, one for South Carolina, one for North
Carolina, and the other for Louisiana. So far as known,
the appointment of each was by simple letter from the
Secretary of War. But if this can be done in four States,
where is the limit? It may be done in every Rebel State;
and if not in every other State of the Union, it will be
simply because the existence of a valid State government
excludes the exercise of this extraordinary power. Assuming,
that, as our arms prevail, it will be done in every
Rebel State, we shall then have <i>eleven</i> military governors,
all deriving authority from one source, ruling a population
amounting to upwards of nine millions. And
this imperatorial dominion, indefinite in extent, will
also be indefinite in duration; for, if, under the Constitution
and laws, it be proper to constitute such governors,
it is clear that they may be continued without
regard to time,&mdash;for years, if you please, as well as
for weeks; and the whole region they are called to
sway will be a military empire, with all powers, executive,
legislative, and even judicial, derived from one man
in Washington. Talk of “the one-man power!” Here
it is with a vengeance. Talk of military rule! Here it
is, in the name of a republic.</p>

<p>The bare statement of this case may put us on our
guard. We may well hesitate to organize a single State
under military government, when we see where such
step leads. If you approve one, you must approve
eleven, and the National Government may crystallize
into military despotism.</p>

<p>In appointing military governors of States, we follow
an approved example in certain cases beyond the jurisdiction
of the National Constitution,&mdash;as in California<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
and Mexico, after their conquest, and before peace. It
is evident that in these cases there was no constraint
from the Constitution, and we were perfectly free to act
according to the assumed exigency. It may be proper
to set up military governors for a conquered country
beyond our civil jurisdiction, and yet it may be questionable
if we should undertake to set up such governors
in States that we all claim to be within our civil jurisdiction.
At all events, the two cases are different, so
that it is not easy to argue from one to the other.</p>

<p>In Jefferson’s Inaugural Address, where he develops
what he calls “the essential principles of our Government,
and consequently those which ought to shape its
administration,” he mentions “<i>the supremacy of the civil
over the military authority</i>” as one of these “essential
principles,” and then says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These should be the creed of our political faith, the text
of civil instruction, the touchstone by which to try the services
of those we trust; and should we wander from them
in moments of error or alarm, let us hasten to retrace our
steps, and to regain the road which alone leads to peace,
liberty, and safety.”<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Undertaking to create military governors of States, we
reverse the policy of the Republic, as solemnly declared
by Jefferson, and subject the civil to the military authority.
If this has been done in patriotic ardor, without
due consideration, in a moment of error or alarm, it
only remains, that, according to Jefferson, we should
“hasten to retrace our steps, and to regain the road
which alone leads to peace, liberty, and safety.”</p>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun, and the military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
governors we are beginning to appoint find a prototype
in the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. After the execution
of the King and the establishment of the Commonwealth,
the Protector conceived the idea of parcelling
the kingdom into military districts, of which there
were <i>eleven</i>, being precisely the number now proposed,
under favor of success, among us. Of this system a
great authority, Mr. Hallam, speaks thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To govern according to law may sometimes be an usurper’s
wish, but can seldom be in his power. The Protector
abandoned all thought of it. Dividing the kingdom into
districts, he placed at the head of each a major-general, as
<i>a sort of military magistrate</i>, responsible for the subjection
of his prefecture. These were <i>eleven in number</i>, men bitterly
hostile to the royalist party, and insolent towards all civil
authority.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Carlyle, in his Life of Cromwell, gives a glimpse of
this military government.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The beginning of a universal scheme of Major-Generals,
the Lord Protector and his Council of State having well considered
and found it the feasiblest,&mdash;‘if not <i>good</i>, yet best.’ …
‘It is an arbitrary government,’ murmur many. Yes,
arbitrary, but beneficial. <i>These are powers unknown to the
English Constitution, I believe; but they are very necessary
for the Puritan English nation at this time.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps no better words could be found in explanation
of the Cromwellian policy adopted by our President.</p>

<p>A contemporary republican, Lieutenant-General Ludlow,
whose “Memoirs” add to the authentic history of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
those interesting times, characterizes these military magistrates
as so many “bashaws.” Here are some of his
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The major-generals carried things with unheard-of insolence
in their several precincts, decimating to extremity
whom they pleased, and interrupting the proceedings at law
upon petitions of those who pretended themselves aggrieved;
<i>threatening such as would not yield a ready submission to their
orders with transportation to Jamaica, or some other plantations
in the West Indies</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again, says the same contemporary writer,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There were sometimes bitter reflections cast upon the
proceedings of the major-generals by the lawyers and country
gentlemen, who accused them to have done many things
oppressive to the people, in interrupting the course of the
law, <i>and threatening such as would not submit to their arbitrary
orders with transportation beyond the seas</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At last, even Cromwell, at the height of his power,
found it necessary to abandon the policy of military
governors. He authorized his son-in-law, Mr. Claypole,
to announce in Parliament, “that he had formerly
thought it necessary, in respect to the condition in
which the nation had been, that the major-generals
should be intrusted with the authority which they had
exercised; but, in the present state of affairs, he conceived
it inconsistent with the laws of England and
liberties of the people to continue their power any
longer.”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The conduct of at least one of our military magistrates
seems to have been a counterpart to that of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
“bashaws” of Cromwell; and there is no argument
against that early military despotism which may not
be urged against any attempt to revive it in our day.
Some of the acts of Governor Stanly in North Carolina
are in themselves an argument against the whole system.</p>

<p>It is clear that these military magistrates are without
direct sanction in the Constitution or existing laws.
They are not even “major-generals,” or other military
officers, charged with the duty of enforcing martial law,
but special creations of the Secretary of War, acting
under the President, and charged with universal powers.
As governors within the limits of a State, they obviously
assume the extinction of the old State governments
for which they are substituted, and the President, in appointing
them, assumes a power over these States kindred
to his acknowledged power over Territories of the
Union; but, in appointing governors for Territories, he
acts in pursuance of the Constitution and laws, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>

<p>That the President should assume the vacation of the
State governments is of itself no argument against the
creation of military governors, for it is simply the assumption
of an unquestionable fact; but if it be true
that the State governments have ceased to exist, then
the way is prepared for the establishment of provisional
governments by Congress. In short, if a new government
is to be supplied, it should be by Congress rather
than by the President, and it should be according to
established law rather than according to the mere will
of any functionary, to the end that ours may be “a government
of laws, and not of men.”</p>

<p>There is no argument for military governors which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
not equally strong for Congressional governments, while
the latter have in their favor two controlling considerations:
first, that they proceed from the civil rather
than the military power; and, secondly, that they are
created by law. Therefore, in considering whether Congressional
governments should be constituted, I begin by
assuming everything in their favor that is already accorded
to the other system. I should not do this, if the
system of military dictators were not now recognized;
so that the question is sharply presented, which of the
two to choose. Even if provisional governments by Congress
are unconstitutional, it does not follow that military
governments, without the sanction of Congress, can
be constitutional. But, on the other hand, I cannot
doubt, that, if military governments are constitutional,
then surely the provisional governments by Congress
must be so also. In truth, there can be no opening for
military governments which is not also an opening for
Congressional governments, with this great advantage
for the latter, that they are in harmony with our institutions,
which favor the civil rather than the military
power.</p>

<p>Thus declaring deliberate preference for Congressional
governments, I am sustained by obvious reason. But
there is positive authority on this identical question. I
refer to the recorded opinion of Chancellor Kent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Though the Constitution vests the executive power in
the President, and declares him to be commander-in-chief of
the army and navy of the United States, <i>these powers must
necessarily be subordinate to the legislative power in Congress</i>.
It would appear to me to be the policy or true construction
of this simple and general grant of executive power to the
President, not to suffer it to interfere with those specific
powers of Congress which are more safely deposited in the
legislative department, and that <i>the powers thus assumed by
the President do not belong to him, but to Congress</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the weighty testimony of this esteemed master
on the assumption of power by the President, in
1847, over Mexican ports in our possession. It is found
in the latest edition of his “Commentaries” that enjoyed
the supervision of the author. Of course, it is
equally applicable to the recent assumptions within our
own territory. His judgment is clear in favor of Congressional
governments.</p>

<p>In ordinary times, and under ordinary circumstances,
neither system of government would be valid. A State
in the full enjoyment of its rights would spurn a military
governor or a Congressional governor. It would
insist that its governor should be neither military nor
Congressional, but such as its own people chose to elect;
and nobody would question this right. The President
does not think of sending a military governor to New
York; nor does Congress think of establishing a provisional
government in that State. It is only with regard
to the Rebel States that this question arises. The occasion,
then, for the exercise of this extraordinary power
is found in the Rebellion. Without the Rebellion there
would be no talk of any governor, whether military or
Congressional.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here it becomes important to consider the operation
of the Rebellion in opening the way to this question.
To this end we must understand the relations between
the States and the National Government, under the
Constitution of the United States. As I approach this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
question of singular delicacy, let me say on the threshold,
that for all those rights of the States which are
consistent with the peace, security, and permanence of
the Union, according to the objects grandly announced
in the Preamble of the Constitution, I am the strenuous
advocate at all times and places. Never, through any
word or act of mine, shall those rights be impaired; nor
shall any of those other rights be called in question by
which the States are held in harmonious relations as
well with each other as with the Union. But, while
thus strenuous for all that justly belongs to the States,
I cannot concede to them immunities inconsistent with
that Constitution which is the supreme law of the land;
nor can I admit the impeccability of a State.</p>

<p>From a period even anterior to the National Constitution,
there has been a perverse pretension of State
Rights, which has perpetually interfered with the unity
of our Government. Throughout the Revolution this
pretension was a check upon the powers of Congress,
whether in respect to armies or finances, so that it was
too often constrained to content itself with the language
of advice or persuasion rather than of command.
By the Declaration of Independence it was solemnly
declared that “these United Colonies are, and of right
ought to be, free and independent <i>States</i>” and that, as
such, “they have full power to levy war, conclude peace,
contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all
other acts and things which independent <i>States</i> may of
right do.” Thus, by this original charter, the early Colonies
were changed into independent States, under whose
protection the liberties of the country were placed.</p>

<p>Early steps were taken to supply the deficiencies of
this government, which was effective only through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
generous patriotism of the people. In July, 1778, two
years after the Declaration, Articles of Confederation
were ratified by nine States, but the assent of all was
not obtained till March, 1781. The character of this
new government, which assumed the style of “The
United States of America,” appears in the title of these
Articles, which was as follows: “Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union <i>between the States</i> of New
Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode-Island and Providence
Plantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia.” By the second
article it was declared that “<i>each State retains its sovereignty</i>,
freedom, and independence, and every power,
jurisdiction, and right which is not by this Confederation
expressly delegated to the United States in Congress
assembled.” By the third article it was further
declared that “the said <i>States</i> hereby severally enter
into <i>a firm league</i> of friendship with each other, for
their common defence, the security of their liberties, and
their mutual and general welfare.” By another article,
a “committee of the <i>States</i>, or any nine of them,” was
authorized, in the recess, to execute the powers of Congress.
The government thus constituted was a compact
between <i>sovereign States</i>, or, according to its precise language,
“a firm league of friendship” between these <i>States</i>,
administered, in the recess of Congress, by a “committee
of <i>the States</i>.” Thus did State Rights triumph.</p>

<p>But the imbecility of the Confederation, from this
pretension, soon became apparent. As early as December,
1782, a committee of Congress made an elaborate
report on the refusal of Rhode Island, one of the States,
to confer certain powers on Congress with regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
revenue and commerce. In April, 1783, an Address of
Congress to <i>the States</i> was put forth, appealing to their
justice and plighted faith, and representing the consequence
of failure on their part to sustain the Government
and provide for its wants. In April, 1784, a similar
appeal was made to what were called “the several
States,” whose Legislatures were recommended to vest
“the United States in Congress assembled” with certain
powers. In July, 1785, a committee of Congress made
another elaborate report on the reason why the States
should confer upon Congress powers therein enumerated,
in the course of which it was urged, that, “unless
<i>the States</i> act together, there is no plan of policy into
which they can separately enter which they will not be
separately interested to defeat, and of course all their
measures must prove vain and abortive.” In February
and March, 1786, there were three other reports of committees
of Congress, exhibiting the failure of <i>the States</i>
to comply with the requisitions of Congress, and the
necessity for a complete accession of <i>all the States</i> to
the revenue system. In October, 1786, there was still
another report, most earnestly renewing the former appeals
to <i>the States</i>. Nothing could be more urgent.</p>

<p>As early as July, 1782, even before the first report
to Congress, resolutions were adopted by the State of
New York, declaring “that the situation of <i>these States</i>
is in a peculiar manner critical,” and that “the radical
source of most of our embarrassments is <i>the want of
sufficient power in Congress</i> to effectuate that ready and
perfect coöperation of <i>the different States</i> on which their
immediate safety and future happiness depend.”<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Finally,
in September, 1786, at Annapolis, commissioners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
from several States, after declaring “the situation of the
United States delicate and critical, calling for an exertion
of the united virtue and wisdom of all the members
of the Confederacy,” recommended the meeting of a Convention
“to devise such further provisions as shall appear
to them necessary to render the Constitution of the
Federal Government adequate to the exigencies of the
Union.” In accord with this recommendation, the Congress
of the Confederation proposed a Convention “for
the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of
Confederation, and reporting to Congress and the several
Legislatures such alterations and provisions therein
as shall, when agreed to in Congress and confirmed by
the States, render the Federal Constitution adequate to
the exigencies of government and the preservation of
the Union.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of the call, delegates to the proposed
Convention were duly appointed by the Legislatures
of the several States, and the Convention assembled
at Philadelphia in May, 1787. The present Constitution
was the well-ripened fruit of their deliberations.
In transmitting it to Congress, General Washington,
who was the President of the Convention, in a letter,
bearing date September 17, 1787, uses this instructive
language:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is obviously impracticable, in the Federal Government
of <i>these States, to secure all rights of independent sovereignty to
each</i>, and yet provide for the interest and safety of all. Individuals
entering into society must give up a share of liberty
to preserve the rest. The magnitude of the sacrifice
must depend as well on situation and circumstance as on
the object to be obtained. It is at all times difficult to draw
with precision the line between those rights which must be
surrendered and those which may be reserved; and on the
present occasion this difficulty was increased by a difference
<i>among the several States</i> as to their situation, extent, habits,
and particular interests. In all our deliberations on this
subject, we kept steadily in our view that which appears
to us the greatest interest of every true American, <span class="smcap">the consolidation
of our Union</span>, in which is involved our prosperity,
felicity, safety, perhaps our national existence.”</p>

</div>

<p>These famous words were in harmony with the constant
sentiments of Washington. Here is additional
evidence, from a letter to John Jay, during the summer
of 1786:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have errors to correct. We have probably had too
good an opinion of human nature, in forming our Confederation.
Experience has taught us that men will not adopt
and carry into execution measures the best calculated for
their own good, <i>without the intervention of a coercive power</i>. I
do not conceive we can exist long as a nation without having
lodged somewhere a power which will pervade the whole
Union <i>in as energetic a manner as the authority of the State
governments extends over the several States</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>These are the words of Washington; and he then
proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To be fearful of investing Congress, constituted as that
body is, with ample authorities for national purposes, appears
to me the very climax of popular absurdity and madness.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Constitution was duly transmitted by Congress
to the several Legislatures, by which it was submitted
to Conventions of delegates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> “chosen in each State by
the people thereof,” who ratified the same. Afterwards,
Congress, by resolution, dated September 13, 1788, setting
forth that the Convention had reported “a Constitution
<i>for the people of the United States</i>,” which had
been duly ratified, proceeded to authorize the necessary
elections under the new government.</p>

<p>The Constitution, it will be seen, was framed to remove
difficulties arising from State Rights. So paramount
was this purpose, that, according to the letter
of Washington, it was kept steadily in view in all the
deliberations of the Convention, which did not hesitate
to declare <i>the consolidation of our Union</i> essential to
prosperity, felicity, safety, and perhaps national existence.</p>

<p>The unity of the Government was expressed in the
term “Constitution,” instead of “Articles of Confederation
and Perpetual Union between the States,” and in
the idea of “a more perfect union,” instead of “a firm
league of friendship.” It was also announced emphatically
in the Preamble:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>We, the people of the United States, in order to form a
more perfect union</i>, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
provide for the common defence, promote the general
welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution
for the United States of America.”</p>

</div>

<p>Not “we, the States,” but “we, the people of the
United States.” Such is the beginning and origin of
our Constitution. Here is no compact or league between
States, involving the recognition of State Rights, but a
government ordained and established by the people of
the United States for themselves and their posterity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
This government is not established <i>by the States</i>, nor is
it established <i>for the States</i>; but it is established <i>by the
people</i>, for themselves and their posterity. It is true,
that, in the organization of the government, the existence
of the States is recognized, and the original name
of “United States” is preserved; but the sovereignty
of the States is absorbed in that more perfect union
which was then established. There is but one sovereignty
recognized, and this is the sovereignty of the
United States. To the several States is left that specific
local control which is essential to the convenience and
business of life, while to the United States, as Plural
Unit, is allotted that commanding sovereignty which
embraces and holds the whole country within its perpetual
and irreversible jurisdiction.</p>

<p>This obvious character of the Constitution did not
pass unobserved at the time of its adoption. Indeed,
the Constitution was most strenuously opposed on the
ground that the States were absorbed in the Nation.
In the debates of the Virginia Convention, Patrick
Henry protested against consolidated power.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And here I would make this inquiry of those worthy
characters who composed a part of the late Federal Convention.
I am sure they were fully impressed with the necessity
of forming a great consolidated Government, instead of
a Confederation. <i>That this is a consolidated Government is
demonstrable clear</i>; and the danger of such a Government
is to my mind very striking. I have the highest veneration
for those gentlemen; but, Sir, give me leave to demand,
What right had they to say, ‘<i>We, the people</i>’?… Who
authorized them to speak the language of ‘<i>We, the people</i>,’
instead of ‘<i>We, the States</i>’?”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>And again, at another stage of the debate, the same
patriotic opponent of the Constitution declared succinctly,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The question turns, Sir, on that poor little thing, the
expression, ‘We, <i>the people</i>,’ instead of <i>the States</i>, of America.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the same Convention, another patriotic opponent
of the Constitution, George Mason, following Patrick
Henry, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whether the Constitution be good or bad, the present
clause clearly discovers that it is a National Government,
and no longer a Confederation.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But against all this opposition, and in face of this
exposure, the Constitution was adopted, in the name
of the people of the United States. Much, indeed, was
left to the States; but it was no longer in their name
that the government was organized, while the miserable
pretension of State “sovereignty” was discarded. Even
in the discussions of the National Convention Mr. Madison
spoke thus plainly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some contend that States are <i>sovereign</i>, when, in fact,
they are only political societies. The States never possessed
the essential rights of sovereignty. These were always vested
in Congress.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Grave words, especially when we consider the position
of their author. They were substantially echoed
by Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts, afterwards Vice-President,
who said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears to me that the States never were independent.
They had only corporate rights.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On another occasion, Mr. Madison said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hold it for a fundamental point, that an individual independence
of the States is utterly irreconcilable with the
idea of an aggregate sovereignty.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Better words still fell from Mr. Wilson, of Pennsylvania,
known afterwards as a learned judge of the Supreme
Court, and also for his “Lectures on Law”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Will a regard to State Rights justify the sacrifice of the
rights of men? If we proceed on any other foundation than
the last, our building will neither be solid nor lasting.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The argument was unanswerable then. It is unanswerable
now. You cannot elevate the sovereignty of
the States over the Constitution of the United States.
It would be even more odious than the early pretension
of sovereign power over Magna Charta, according to the
memorable words of Lord Coke, as recorded by Rushworth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sovereign power is no Parliamentary word. In my opinion,
it weakens Magna Charta and all our statutes; for they
are absolute, without any saving of sovereign power; and
shall we now add it, we shall weaken the foundation of law,
and then the building must needs fall. Take we heed what
we yield unto. <i>Magna Charta is such a fellow that he will
have no sovereign.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But the Constitution is our Magna Charta, which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
bear no sovereign but itself, as you will see at once, if
you consider its character. And this practical truth
was recognized at its formation, as may be seen in the
writings of our Rushworth: I refer to Nathan Dane,
who was a member of Congress under the Confederation.
He tells us plainly, that the terms “sovereign
States,” “State sovereignty,” “State rights,” “rights of
States,” are “not constitutional expressions.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the exercise of its sovereignty, Congress is intrusted
with large and peculiar powers. Take notice of them,
and you will see how little of “sovereignty” is left to
the States. Their simple enumeration is an argument
against this pretension. Congress may “lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts and
<i>provide for the common defence and general welfare of the
United States</i>”; it may “borrow money on the credit of
the United States”; “regulate commerce with foreign
nations, and <i>among the several States</i>, and with the Indian
tribes”; “establish an uniform rule of naturalization,
and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies,
<i>throughout the United States</i>”; “coin money, regulate the
value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of
weights and measures”; “provide for the punishment
of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the
United States”; “establish post-offices and post-roads”;
“promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing
for limited times to authors and inventors the
exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries”;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
“constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme
Court”; “define and punish piracies and felonies committed
on the high seas, and offences against the Law
of Nations”; “declare war, grant letters of marque and
reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land
and water”; “raise and support armies”; “provide and
maintain a navy”; “make rules for the government and
regulation of the land and naval forces”; “provide for
calling forth the militia to execute <i>the laws of the Union</i>,
suppress insurrections, and repel invasions”; “provide
for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia,
and for governing such part of them as may be employed
in the service of the United States, reserving to
the States respectively the appointment of the officers,
and the authority of training the militia <i>according to the
discipline prescribed by Congress</i>”; “exercise exclusive
legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over the seat of the
government of the United States, and like authority
over all places purchased by the consent of the Legislature
of the State in which the same shall be, for the
erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and
other needful buildings”; and “make all laws which
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested
by this Constitution in the Government of the United
States, or in any department or officer thereof.”</p>

<p>Such are the ample and diversified powers of Congress,
embracing all those agencies which enter into
sovereignty. With this concession to the United States,
there seems to be little for the several States. In the
power to “declare war” and to “raise and support armies”
Congress possesses an exclusive power, in itself
immense and infinite, over persons and property in the
several States, while, by the power to “regulate commerce,”
it may put limits round about the business of
the several States; and even in the case of the militia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
which is the original military organization of the people,
nothing is left to the States except “the appointment
of the officers,” and the authority to train it “according
to the discipline <i>prescribed by Congress</i>.” Thus
these great functions are all intrusted to the United
States, while the several States are subordinated to
their exercise.</p>

<p>Constantly, and in everything, we behold the constitutional
subordination of the States. But there are other
provisions by which the States are expressly deprived of
important powers. For instance: “No State shall enter
into any treaty, alliance, or confederation; coin money;
emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and silver
coin a tender in payment of debts.” Or, if the States
may exercise certain powers, it is only with the consent
of Congress. For instance: “No State shall, <i>without
the consent of Congress</i>, lay any duty of tonnage, keep
troops or ships of war in time of peace, enter into any
agreement or compact with another State or with a foreign
power.” Here is a magistral power accorded to
Congress utterly inconsistent with the pretensions of
State Rights. Then again: “No State shall, <i>without
the consent of the Congress</i>, lay any imposts or duties on
imports or exports, except what may be absolutely necessary
for executing its inspection laws; and the net
produce of all duties and imposts laid by any State
on imports or exports shall be for the use of the treasury
of the United States; <i>and all such laws shall be
subject to the revision and control of the Congress</i>.” Here,
again, is a similar magistral power accorded to Congress;
and as if still further to deprive the States of their
much vaunted sovereignty, the laws which they make
with the consent of Congress are expressly declared to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
be subject “to the revision and control of the Congress.”
There is still another instance. According to the Constitution,
“Full faith and credit shall be given in each
State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings
of every other State”; but here mark the controlling
power of Congress, which is authorized to “prescribe
the manner in which such acts, records, and proceedings
shall be proved, and the effect thereof.”</p>

<p>There are five other provisions of the Constitution by
which its supremacy is positively established. (1.) “The
citizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges
and immunities of citizens in the several States.” As
Congress has the exclusive power to establish “an uniform
rule of naturalization,” it may, under these words
of the Constitution, secure for its newly entitled citizens
“all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
States,” in defiance of State Rights. (2.) “New States
may be admitted <i>by the Congress</i> into this Union.” According
to these words, the States cannot even determine
their associates, but are dependent in this respect upon
the will of Congress. (3.) Not content with taking from
the States these important functions of sovereignty, it is
solemnly declared that the Constitution, and the laws
of the United States made in pursuance thereof, and all
treaties under the authority of the United States, “<span class="smcap">shall
be the supreme law of the land</span>,&mdash;<i>anything in the
Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding</i>.”
Thus are State Rights again subordinated
to the National Constitution, which is erected into the
paramount authority. (4.) This is done again by another
provision, which declares that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> “<i>the members of the several
State Legislatures</i>, and all executive and judicial
officers both of the United States and of <i>the several
States</i>, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support
this Constitution”; so that not only State laws
are subordinated to the National Constitution, but the
makers of State laws and all other State officers are
constrained to declare allegiance to this Constitution,
thus placing the State, alike through its acts and its
agents, in complete subordination to the sovereignty
of the United States. (5.) This sovereignty is further
proclaimed in the solemn injunction, that “the United
States shall guaranty to every State in this Union a
republican form of government, and shall protect each
of them against invasion.” Here are duties of guaranty
and protection imposed upon the United States, by
which their position is fixed as the supreme power.
There can be no such guaranty without the implied
right to examine and consider the governments of the
several States, and there can be no such protection
without a similar right to examine and consider the
condition of the several States, subjecting them to the
rightful supervision and superintendence of the National
Government.</p>

<p>Thus, whether we regard the large powers vested in
Congress, the powers denied to the States absolutely,
the powers denied to the States without the consent
of Congress, or those other provisions which accord supremacy
to the United States, we find the pretension of
State sovereignty without foundation, except in the imagination
of its partisans. Before the Constitution such
sovereignty may have existed; it was declared in the
Articles of Confederation; but since then it has ceased.
It has disappeared and been lost in the supremacy of
the National Government, so that it can no longer be
recognized. Perverse men, insisting that it still existed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and weak men, mistaking the shadow of former power
for the reality, have made arrogant claims in its behalf.
When the Constitution was proclaimed, and George
Washington took his oath to support it as President,
our career as a nation began, with all the unity of a
nation. The States remained as living parts of the
body, important to the national strength, and essential
to those currents which maintain national life, but
plainly subordinate to the United States, which then
and there stood forth a nation, one and indivisible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The new Government had hardly been inaugurated
before it was disturbed by the pestilent pretension of
State Rights, which has never ceased to disturb it since.
Discontent with the treaty between the United States
and Great Britain, negotiated by that purest patriot,
John Jay, under instructions from Washington, in 1794,
led Virginia, even at that early day, to commence an
opposition to its ratification, <i>in the name of State Rights</i>.
Shortly afterwards appeared the famous resolutions of
Virginia and of Kentucky, usually known as the “Resolutions
of ’98,” declaring that the National Government
was founded on compact between the States, and claiming
for the States the right to sit in judgment on the
National Government, and to interpose, if they thought
fit: all this, as you will see, <i>in the name of State Rights</i>.
This pretension increased, till, at last, on the mild proposition
to attach a prospective prohibition of Slavery
as a condition to the admission of Missouri into the
Union as a new State, the opposition raged furiously,
even to the extent of menacing the existence of the Union;
and this, too, was done <i>in the name of State Rights</i>.
Ten years later the pretension took the famous form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
of Nullification, insisting that the National Government
was only a compact of States, any one of which was free
to annul an Act of Congress at its own pleasure; and
all this <i>in the name of State Rights</i>. For a succession
of years afterwards,&mdash;at the presentation of petitions
against Slavery, petitions for the recognition of Hayti,
at the question of Texas, at the Wilmot Proviso, at the
admission of California as a Free State, at the discussion
of the Compromises of 1850, at the Kansas Question,&mdash;the
Union was menaced; and always <i>in the name of State
Rights</i>. The menace was constant; and it sometimes
showed itself on small as well as great occasions, but
always <i>in the name of State Rights</i>. When it was supposed
that Fremont was about to be chosen President
the menace became louder, and mingling with it was
the hoarse mutter of war; and all this audacity was
<i>in the name of State Rights</i>.</p>

<p>But in the autumn of 1860, on the election of Abraham
Lincoln, the case became much worse. Scarcely
was the result known by telegraph, before the country
was startled by other intelligence, to the effect that certain
States at the South were about to put in execution
the long pending threat of Secession, of course <i>in
the name of State Rights</i>. First came South Carolina,
which, by Ordinance adopted in a State Convention, undertook
to repeal the original Act by which the Constitution
was adopted in this State, and to declare that
South Carolina had ceased to be one of the States of
the Union. At the same time a Declaration of Independence
was put forth by the State, which proceeded
to organize as an independent community. This example
was followed successively by other States, which, by
formal Acts of Secession, undertook to dissolve relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
with the Union, always, be it understood, <i>in the name
of State Rights</i>. A new Confederation was formed by
these States, with a new Constitution, and Jefferson
Davis at its head; and the same oaths of loyalty by
which the local functionaries of all these States had been
bound to the Union were now transferred to this new
Confederation, of course in utter violation of the Constitution
of the United States, but always <i>in the name
of State Rights</i>. The Ordinances of Secession were next
maintained by war, which, beginning with the assault
upon Fort Sumter, convulsed the whole country, till, at
last, all the States of the new Confederation were in open
rebellion, which the Government of the United States is
now exerting its energies, mustering its forces, and taxing
its people to suppress. The original claim, <i>in the
name of State Rights</i>, has swollen to all the proportions
of an unparalleled war, which, <i>in the name of State Rights</i>,
now menaces the national life.</p>

<p>The pretensions in the name of State Rights are not
all told. While the Ordinances of Secession were maturing,
and before they were yet consummated, Mr.
Buchanan, who was then President, declined to interfere,
on the ground that what had been done was by
States, and that it was contrary to the theory of our
Government “to coerce a State,” thus making the pretension
of State Rights the apology for imbecility. Had
the President then interfered promptly and loyally, it
cannot be doubted that this whole intolerable crime
might have been trampled out forever. And now, when
it is proposed that Congress shall organize governments
in these States, which are absolutely without loyal governments,
we are met by the objection founded on State
Rights. The same disastrous voice which from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
beginning of our history has sounded in our ears still
makes itself heard; but, alas! it is now on the lips of
friends. Just in proportion as it prevails, it is impossible
to establish the Constitution again throughout the
Rebel States. State Rights are fully triumphant, if,
first, in their name Rebel governments can be organized,
and then again in their name Congressional governments
to replace the Rebel governments can be
resisted. If they can be employed, first to sever the
States from the Union, and then to prevent the Union
from extending its power over them, State Rights are
at once sword and buckler to the Rebellion. It was
through the imbecility of Mr. Buchanan that the States
were allowed to use the sword: God forbid that now,
through any similar imbecility of Congress, they shall
be allowed to use the buckler!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And here we are brought to the practical question
destined to occupy so much of public attention. It is
proposed to bring the action of Congress to bear directly
upon the Rebel States. This may be by the establishment
of provisional governments under authority of
Congress, or simply by making the admission or recognition
of the States depend upon the action of Congress.
The essential feature of the proposition is, <i>that Congress
shall assume jurisdiction of the Rebel States</i>. A bill authorizing
provisional governments in these States was
introduced into the Senate by Mr. Harris, of the State
of New York, and was afterwards reported from the Judiciary
Committee of that body; but it was left with
unfinished business, when the late Congress expired on
the fourth of March. The opposition to this proposition,
so far as I understand it, assumes two forms: first, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
these States are always to be regarded as States, with
much vaunted State Rights, and therefore cannot be governed
by Congress; and, secondly, that, if any government
is to be established over them, it must be simply a military
government, with a military governor appointed by
the President, as is the case with Tennessee and North
Carolina. But State Rights are as much disturbed by a
military government as by a Congressional government.
The local government is as much set aside in one case
as in the other. If the President, within State limits,
can proceed to organize a military government to exercise
all the powers of the State, surely Congress can
proceed to organize a civil government within the same
limits for the same purpose; nor can any pretension of
State Rights be effective against Congress more than
against President. Indeed, the power belongs to Congress
by a higher title than it belongs to President:
first, because a civil government is more in harmony
with our institutions, and, wherever possible, is required;
and, secondly, because there are provisions of the Constitution
under which this power is clearly derived.</p>

<p>Assuming, then, that the pretension of State Rights
is as valid against one form of government as against
the other, and still further assuming, that, in the case
of military governments, this pretension is practically
overruled by the President at least, we are brought
again to consider its efficacy when advanced against
Congressional governments.</p>

<p>It is argued, that the Acts of Secession are all inoperative
and void, and therefore the States continue precisely
as before, with their local constitutions, laws, and institutions
in the hands of traitors, but totally unchanged,
and ready to be quickened into life by returning loyalty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Such, I believe, is a candid statement of the pretension
for State Rights against Congressional governments,
which, it is argued, cannot be substituted for the
State governments.</p>

<p>To prove that the Rebel States continue precisely as
before, we are reminded that Andrew Johnson continued
to occupy his seat in the Senate after Tennessee had
adopted its Act of Secession and embarked in rebellion,
and that his presence testified to the fact that rebel Tennessee
was still a State of the Union. No such conclusion
is authorized by this incident. There are two principles
of Parliamentary Law long ago fixed: first, that
the power once conferred by an election to Parliament
is <i>irrevocable</i>, so that it is not affected by any subsequent
change in the constituency; and, secondly, that a member,
when once chosen, is <i>a member for the whole kingdom</i>,
becoming thereby, according to the words of an
early author, not merely knight, citizen, or burgess of
the county, city, or borough which elected him, but
knight, citizen, or burgess of England.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> If these two
principles are not entirely inapplicable to our political
system, then the seat of Andrew Johnson was not in
any respect affected by the subsequent madness of his
State, nor can the legality of his seat be any argument
for his State.</p>

<p>We are also reminded, that, during the last session of
Congress, two Senators from Virginia represented that
State in the Senate, and the argument is pressed that no
such representation would be valid, if the State government
of Virginia was vacated. This is a mistake. Two
things are established by the presence of these Senators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
in the National Senate: first, that the old State government
of Virginia is extinct; and, secondly, that a
new government has been set up in its place. It was
my fortune to hear one of these Senators, while earnestly
denouncing the idea that a State government
could disappear. I could not but think that he strangely
forgot the principle to which he owed his seat in the
Senate, as men sometimes forget a benefactor.</p>

<p>It is true beyond question that the Acts of Secession
are all inoperative and void against the Constitution of
the United States. Though matured in successive conventions,
sanctioned in various forms, and maintained
ever since by bloody war, these Acts, no matter by what
name they may be called, are all equally impotent to
withdraw an acre of territory or a single inhabitant
from the rightful jurisdiction of the nation. But while
thus impotent against the United States, it does not follow
that they were equally impotent in the work of
self-destruction. Clearly, the Rebels, by utmost effort,
could not impair the national jurisdiction; but it remains
to be seen if their enmity did not act back with
fatal rebound upon those very State Rights in behalf of
which they commenced their treason.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is sometimes said that the States themselves committed
<i>suicide</i>, so that, as States, they ceased to exist,
leaving their whole jurisdiction open to the occupation
of the United States under the Constitution. This assumption
is founded on the fact, that, whatever the
existing governments in these States, they are in no
respect constitutional; and since the State itself is
known by the government with which its life is intertwined,
it must cease to exist constitutionally when its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
government no longer exists constitutionally. It were
better, perhaps, to avoid the whole question of life or
death in the State, and content ourselves with inquiry
into the condition of its government. It is not easy to
say what constitutes that entity we call a State; nor is
the discussion much advanced by any theory. To my
mind it seems a topic fit for the old schoolmen or a
modern debating society; and yet, considering the part
it has already played, I shall be pardoned for a brief
allusion to it.</p>

<p>There are well-known words which ask and answer
the question, “What constitutes a <i>State</i>?” But the
scholarly poet<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> was not thinking of a “State” of the
American Union. Indeed, this term is various in use.
Sometimes it stands for civil society itself. Sometimes
it is the general name for a political community, not
unlike “nation” or “country,”&mdash;as when our fathers,
in the Resolution of Independence which preceded the
Declaration, spoke of “the <i>State</i> of Great Britain.”
Sometimes it stands for the government,&mdash;as when
Louis the Fourteenth, at the height of his power, exclaimed,
“The <i>State</i>, it is I,”&mdash;or when Sir Christopher
Hatton, in the famous farce of “The Critic,” ejaculated,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I cannot but surmise,&mdash;forgive, my friend,</div>
<div class="verse">If the conjecture’s rash,&mdash;I cannot but</div>
<div class="verse">Surmise <i>the State</i> some danger apprehends.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among us the term is most known as the technical
name for one of the political societies composing our
Union. When used in this restricted sense, it must
not be confounded with the same term when used in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
a different and broader sense. But it is obvious that
some persons attribute to the one something of the qualities
which can belong only to the other. Nobody has
suggested, I presume, that any “State” of our Union
has, through rebellion, ceased to exist as a <i>civil society</i>,
or even as a <i>political community</i>. It is only as a <i>State
of the Union</i>, armed with State Rights, or at least as a
<i>local government</i>, annually renewing itself, as the snake
its skin, that it can be called in question. But it is
vain to challenge for the technical “State,” or for the
annual government, that immortality which belongs to
civil society. The one is an artificial body, the other
is a natural body; and while the former, overwhelmed
by insurrection or war, may change or die, the latter can
change or die only with the extinction of the community
itself, whatever its name or its form.</p>

<p>It is because of confusion in the use of this term that
there has been so much confusion in the political controversies
where it has been employed. But nowhere
has this confusion led to greater absurdity than in the
pretension recently made in the name of State Rights,&mdash;as
if it were reasonable to claim for a technical
“State” of the Union that immortality belonging to
civil society.</p>

<p>From approved authorities it appears that a “State,”
even in a broader signification, may lose its life. Dr.
Phillimore, in his recent work on International Law,
says: “A State, like an individual, may die,” and among
the various ways, he says, “by its submission, and the
donation of itself, as it were, to another country.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> But
in the case of our Rebel States there has been a plain
submission and donation of themselves, <i>effective, at least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to break the continuity of government</i>, if not to destroy
that immortality which is claimed. Nor can it make
any difference, in breaking this continuity, that the submission
and donation, constituting a species of attornment,
are to enemies at home rather than to enemies
abroad,&mdash;to Jefferson Davis rather than to Louis Napoleon.
The thread is snapped in one case as much as
in the other.</p>

<p>But <i>change of form</i> in the actual government may be
equally effective. Cicero speaks of change so complete
as “to leave no image of a State behind.” This is precisely
what has been done throughout the whole Rebel
region: no image of a <i>constitutional</i> State is left behind.
Another authority, Aristotle, whose words are always
weighty, says, that, <i>the form of the State being changed,
the State is no longer the same</i>, as the harmony is not the
same when we modulate out of the Dorian mood into
the Phrygian. But, if ever an unlucky people modulated
out of one mood into another, it was our Rebels,
when they undertook to modulate out of the harmonies
of the Constitution into their bloody discords.</p>

<p>Without stopping further for these diversions, I content
myself with the testimony of Edmund Burke, who,
in a striking passage, which seems to have been written
for us, portrays the extinction of a political community;
but I quote his eloquent words rather for suggestion
than authority.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In a state of rude Nature there is no such thing as a
people. A number of men in themselves have no collective
capacity. The idea of a people is the idea of a corporation.
It is wholly artificial, and made, like all other legal fictions,
by common agreement. What the particular nature of that
agreement was is collected from the form into which the
particular society has been cast. Any other is not <i>their</i>
covenant. <i>When men, therefore, break up the original compact
or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity
to a state, they are no longer a people, they have no longer a
corporate existence</i>, they have no longer a legal coactive force
to bind within, nor a claim to be recognized abroad. They
are a number of vague, loose individuals, and nothing more.
With them all is to begin again. Alas! they little know
how many a weary step is to be taken before they can form
themselves into a mass which has a true politic personality.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If that great master of eloquence could be heard, who
can doubt that he would stamp our Rebel States as
senseless communities who have sacrificed that corporate
existence which makes them living, component
members of our Union of States?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again, it is sometimes said that the States, by flagrant
treason, have <i>forfeited</i> their rights as States, so as to be
civilly dead. It is a patent and indisputable fact, that
this gigantic treason was inaugurated with all the forms
of law known to the States; that it was carried forward
not only by individuals, but also by States, so far as
States can perpetrate treason; that the States pretended
to withdraw bodily, in their corporate capacities; that
the Rebellion, as it showed itself, was <i>by</i> States, as well
as <i>in</i> States; that it was by the governments of States,
as well as by the people of States; and that, to the common
observer, the crime was consummated by the several
corporations, as well as by the individuals of whom
they were composed. From this fact, obvious to all, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
is argued, that, since, according to Blackstone, a traitor
“hath abandoned his connections with society, and hath
no longer any right to those advantages which before belonged
to him purely as a member of the community,”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
by the same principle the traitor State is no longer to
be regarded as a member of the Union. But it is not
necessary, on the present occasion, to insist on the application
of any such principle to States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Again, it is said that the States by their treason and
rebellion, levying war upon the National Government,
have <i>abdicated</i> their places in the Union; and here the
argument is upheld by the historic example of England
at the Revolution of 1688, when, on the flight of James
and the abandonment of his kingly duties, the two
Houses of Parliament voted, that the monarch, “having
violated the fundamental laws, and having withdrawn
himself out of this kingdom, <i>has abdicated the
government</i>, and that the throne is thereby vacant.”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
But it is not necessary for us to rely on any allegation
of abdication, applicable as it may be.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It only remains that we should see things as they
are, and not seek to substitute theory for fact. On this
important question I discard all theory, whether of State
suicide, or State forfeiture, or State abdication, on the
one side, or of State Rights, immortal and unimpeachable,
on the other side. Such discussions are only endless
mazes, in which a whole Senate may be lost. And
discarding all theory, I discard also the jural question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
whether, for instance, the Rebel States, while the Rebellion
is flagrant, are <i>de jure</i> States of the Union, with all
the rights of States. It is enough, that, for the time
being, <i>and in the absence of a loyal government</i>, they can
take no part and perform no function in the Union, <i>so
that they cannot be recognized by the National Government</i>.
The reason is plain. Since there are in these States
no local functionaries bound by constitutional oaths,
there are, in fact, no constitutional functionaries; and as
the State Government is necessarily composed of such
functionaries, there can be no State Government. Thus,
for instance, in South Carolina, Pickens and his associates
may call themselves Governor and Legislature, and
in Virginia Letcher and his associates may call themselves
Governor and Legislature; but we cannot recognize
them as such. Therefore to all pretensions in behalf
of State governments in the Rebel States I oppose
the simple FACT, that, for the time being, no such governments
exist. The broad spaces once occupied by
those governments are now abandoned and vacated.</p>

<p>That loyal Senator, Andrew Johnson,&mdash;faithful among
the faithless, the Abdiel of the South,&mdash;began his attempt
to reorganize Tennessee by an address, as early
as the 18th of March, 1862, in which he made use of
these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I find most, if not all, of the offices, both State and Federal,
<i>vacated, either by actual abandonment or by the action of
the incumbents, in attempting to subordinate their functions</i> to
a power in hostility to the fundamental law of the State and
subversive of her national allegiance.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In employing the word “vacated” Mr. Johnson hit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
upon the very term which, in the famous Resolution of
1688, was held most effective in dethroning King James.
After declaring that he had abdicated the government,
it was added, “that the throne is thereby <i>vacant</i>”; on
which Macaulay happily remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The word <i>abdication</i> conciliated politicians of a more
timid school.… To the real statesman the simple important
clause was that <i>which declared the throne vacant</i>; and if
that clause could be carried, he cared little by what preamble
it might be introduced.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same simple principle is now in issue. It is
enough that the Rebel States be declared <i>vacated</i>, as
<i>in fact</i> they are, by all local government which we are
bound to recognize: so that the way is open to the exercise
of a rightful jurisdiction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here the question occurs, How shall this rightful jurisdiction
be established in the vacated State? Some
there are, so impassioned for State Rights, and so anxious
for forms, even at the expense of substance, that
they insist upon the instant restoration of the old State
governments in all their parts, through the agency of
loyal citizens, who, meanwhile, must be protected in
this work of restoration. But, assuming that all this is
practicable, as it clearly is not, it attributes to the loyal
citizens of a Rebel State, however few in numbers,&mdash;it
may be an insignificant minority,&mdash;a power clearly inconsistent
with the received principle of popular government,
that the majority must rule. The thirteen voters
of Old Sarum were allowed to return two members of
Parliament, because this place,&mdash;once a Roman fort,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
and afterwards a sheep-walk,&mdash;many generations before,
at the early constitution of the House of Commons,
had been entitled to this representation; but the argument
for State Rights assumes that all these rights may
be lodged in voters as few in number as ever controlled
a rotten borough of England.</p>

<p>Pray, admitting that an insignificant minority is to
organize the new government, how shall it be done, and
by whom shall it be set in motion? In putting these
questions, I open the difficulties. As the original government
has ceased to exist, and there are none who
can be its legal successors so as to administer the requisite
oaths, it is not easy to see how the new government
can be set in motion, without resort to some revolutionary
proceeding, instituted either by the citizens or by
the military power,&mdash;unless Congress, in the exercise
of its plenary authority, should undertake to organize
the new jurisdiction.</p>

<p>But every revolutionary proceeding is to be avoided.
It is within the recollection of all familiar with our
history, that our fathers, while regulating the separation
of the Colonies from the parent country, were careful
that all should be done according to forms of law,
so that <i>the thread of legality</i> should continue unbroken.
To this end the Continental Congress interfered by
supervising direction. But the Tory argument denied
the power of Congress then as earnestly as now. Mr.
Duane, of the Continental Congress, made himself its
mouthpiece.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Congress ought not to determine a point of this sort, about
instituting government.</i> What is it to Congress how justice
is administered? You have no right to pass the resolution,
any more than Parliament has. How does it appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>that no favorable answer is likely to be given to our
petitions?”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In spite of this argument, the Congress of that day undertook,
by formal resolutions, to indicate the process by
which the new governments should be constituted.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>If we seek for the principle which entered into this
proceeding of the Continental Congress, we find it in
the idea that nothing can be left to illegal or informal
action, but that all must be done according to rules of
constitution and law previously ordained. Perhaps this
principle has never been more distinctly or powerfully
enunciated than by Mr. Webster, in his speech against
the Dorr Constitution in Rhode Island. According to
him, this principle is a fundamental part of what he
calls our American system, under which the right of suffrage
is prescribed by <i>previous law</i>, including its qualifications,
the time and place of its exercise, and the manner
of its exercise; and then, again, the results are certified
to the central power by some certain rule, <i>by some
known public officers</i>, in some clear and definite form,
thus accomplishing two things: first, that every man
entitled to vote may vote; secondly, that his vote may
be sent forward and counted, so that practically he
may exercise his part of sovereignty in common with
his fellow-citizens. Such, according to Mr. Webster,
are minute forms which must be followed, if we would
impart to the result the crowning character of law.
And here are other positive words from him on this
important point.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are not to take the will of the people from public
meetings, nor from tumultuous assemblies, by which the
timid are terrified, the prudent are alarmed, and by which
society is disturbed. These are not American modes of signifying
the will of the people, and they never were.”</p>

<p>“Is it not obvious enough, that men cannot get together
and count themselves, and say they are so many hundreds
and so many thousands, and judge of their own qualifications,
and call themselves the people, and set up a government?
<i>Why, another set of men, forty miles off, on the same day, with
the same propriety, with as good qualifications, and in as large
numbers, may meet and set up another government.</i>”</p>

<p>“When, in the course of events, it becomes necessary to
ascertain the will of the people on a new exigency or a new
state of things or of opinion, <i>the legislative power provides for
that ascertainment by an ordinary act of legislation</i>.”</p>

<p>“What do I contend for? I say that the will of the people
must prevail, when it is ascertained; but there must be
<i>some legal and authentic mode of ascertaining that will</i>, and then
the people may make what government they please.”</p>

<p>“All that is necessary here is, that the will of the people
should be ascertained by some regular rule of proceeding,
<i>prescribed by previous law</i>.”</p>

<p>“But the law and the Constitution, the whole system of
American institutions, do not contemplate a case in which
a resort will be necessary to proceedings <i>aliunde</i>, or <i>outside
of the law and the Constitution</i>, for the purpose of amending
the frame of government.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Happily, we are not constrained to any such revolutionary
proceeding. The new governments can all be
organized by Congress, which is the natural guardian
of the people, without any immediate government, and
within the jurisdiction of the National Constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Indeed, with the State governments already <i>vacated</i> by
Rebellion, the Constitution becomes, for the time, the
supreme and only law, binding alike on President and
Congress, so that neither can establish any law or institution
incompatible with it; and the whole Rebel region,
deprived of all local government, lapses under the exclusive
jurisdiction of Congress, precisely as any other territory,&mdash;or,
in other words, the negation of the local government
leaves the whole vast region without any other
government than Congress, unless the President should
undertake to govern it by military power. Startling as
this proposition may seem, especially to all who believe
that there is a “divinity doth hedge” a State hardly
less than a king, it will appear, on careful consideration,
to be as well founded in the Constitution as it is simple
and natural, while it affords easy and constitutional solution
to all present embarrassments.</p>

<p>I have no theory to maintain, but only the truth;
and in presenting this argument for Congressional government
I simply follow teachings which I cannot control.
The wisdom of Socrates, in the words of Plato,
has aptly described these teachings, when he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These things, as I affirm, are held and bound (though it
is somewhat rude to say so) in reasons of iron and adamant,
as would really appear to be the case,&mdash;so that, unless you,
or some one stronger than you, can break them, it is not
possible that any one who says otherwise than as I now say
can speak correctly; for my statement is always the same,&mdash;that
I know not how these things are, but that of all the
persons with whom I have ever conversed, as now with you,
no one who says otherwise can avoid being ridiculous.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Show me that I am wrong, that this conclusion is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
founded in the Constitution, and is not sustained by
reason, and I shall at once renounce it; for, in the
present condition of affairs, there can be no pride of
opinion which must not fall at once before the sacred
demands of country. Not as partisan, not as advocate,
do I make this appeal, but simply as citizen, seeking,
in all sincerity, to offer my contribution to the establishment
of that policy by which Union and Peace may be
restored.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Looking at the origin of this power in Congress, we
find that it comes from three distinct fountains, any one
of which is ample to supply it. Three fountains, generous
and hospitable, are found in the Constitution ready
for this occasion.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> From the necessity of the case, <i>ex necessitate
rei</i>, Congress must have jurisdiction over every portion
of the United States <i>where there is no other government</i>;
and since in the present case there is no other government,
the whole region falls within the jurisdiction of
Congress. This jurisdiction is incident, if you please,
to that guardianship and eminent domain belonging to
the United States over all its territory and the people
thereof, and springing into activity when the local government
ceases. It can be questioned only in the name
of the local government; but since this government has
disappeared in the Rebel States, the jurisdiction of Congress
is uninterrupted there. The whole broad Rebel
region is <i>tabula rasa</i>, or “a clean slate,” where Congress,
under the Constitution of the United States, may write
the laws. In adopting this principle, I follow the
authority of the Supreme Court of the United States
in determining the jurisdiction of Congress over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Territories. Here are the words of Chief-Justice Marshall:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Perhaps the power of governing a Territory belonging
to the United States, which has not, by becoming a State,
acquired the means of self-government, <i>may result necessarily
from the facts that it is not within the jurisdiction of any particular
State</i>, and is within the power and jurisdiction of the
United States. The right to govern may be the inevitable
consequence of the right to acquire territory.”<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If the right to govern may be the inevitable consequence
of the right to acquire territory, surely, and by
much stronger reason, this right must be the inevitable
consequence of the sovereignty of the United States,
wherever there is no local government.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The jurisdiction may also be derived from
the <i>Rights of War</i>, which surely are not less abundant
for Congress than for President. If the President, disregarding
the pretension of State Rights, can appoint
military governors within the Rebel States to serve a
temporary purpose, who can doubt that Congress can
exercise a similar jurisdiction? That of the President
is derived from the war powers; but these are not sealed
to Congress. If it be asked, where in the Constitution
such powers are bestowed upon Congress, I reply, that
they are found precisely where the President now finds
his powers. But it is clear that the powers to “declare
war,” to “suppress insurrections,” and to “support armies”
are all ample for this purpose. It is Congress
that conquers, and the same authority that conquers
must govern. Nor is this authority derived from any
strained construction; it springs from the very heart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
the Constitution. It is among those powers, latent in
peace, which war and insurrection call into being, but
as intrinsically constitutional as any other power.</p>

<p>Even if not conceded to the President, these powers
must be conceded to Congress. Would you know their
extent? They are found in the authoritative texts of
Public Law,&mdash;in the works of Grotius, Vattel, and
Wheaton. They are the powers conceded by civilized
society to nations at war, known as Rights of War,&mdash;at
once multitudinous and minute, vast and various.
It would be strange, if Congress could organize armies
and navies to conquer, and could not also organize governments
to protect.</p>

<p>De Tocqueville, who saw our institutions with so keen
an eye, remarked, that, since, in spite of all political
fictions, the preponderating power resided in the States
and not in the nation, a civil war here would be “nothing
but foreign war in disguise.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Of course the natural
consequence would be to give the nation, in such a
civil war, all the rights it would have in a foreign war.
And this conclusion from the observation of the ingenious
publicist has been practically adopted by the Supreme
Court of the United States, in those recent cases
where this tribunal, after most learned argument, followed
by most careful consideration, adjudged, that,
since the Act of Congress of July 13, 1861, the nation
has been waging “a <i>territorial</i> civil war,” in which all
property afloat, belonging to a resident of the <i>belligerent
territory</i>, is liable to capture and condemnation as lawful
prize. But, surely, if the nation may stamp upon
all residents in this <i>belligerent territory</i> the character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
foreign enemies, so as to subject ships and cargoes to
the penalties of confiscation, it may perform the milder
service of making all needful rules and regulations for
the government of this territory under the Constitution,
so long as requisite for the sake of peace and order;
and since the object of war is “indemnity for the past
and security for the future,” it may do everything necessary
to make these effectual. But it will not be enough
to crush the Rebellion; its terrible root must be exterminated,
so that it may no more flourish in blood.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> There is another source for this jurisdiction
common alike to Congress and the President. It is
found in the constitutional provision, that “the United
States shall guaranty to every State in this Union a
republican form of government, and shall protect each
of them against invasion.” Here, be it observed, are
words of guaranty and an obligation of protection. In
the original concession to the United States of this twofold
power there was open recognition of the ultimate
responsibility and duty of the National Government,
<i>conferring jurisdiction above all pretended State Rights</i>;
and now the occasion has come for the exercise of this
twofold power thus solemnly conceded. The words of
twofold power and corresponding obligation are plain,
and beyond question. If there be any ambiguity, it is
only in what constitutes a republican form of government.
But for the present this question does not arise.
It is enough that a wicked rebellion has undertaken to
detach certain States from the Union, and to take them
beyond its protection and sovereignty, with the menace
of seeking foreign alliance and support, even at the cost
of every distinctive institution. It is well known that
<i>Mr. Madison anticipated this precise danger from Slavery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and upheld this precise grant of power in order to counteract
the danger</i>. His words, which will be found in
a yet unpublished document produced by Mr. Collamer
in the Senate, seem prophetic.</p>

<p>Among the defects he remarked in the old Confederation
was what he called “want of guaranty to the
States of their constitutions and laws <i>against internal
violence</i>.” In showing why this guaranty was needed,
he says, that, “according to republican theory, right
and power, being both vested in the majority, are held
to be synonymous; according to fact and experience, a
minority may, in an appeal to force, be an overmatch
for the majority”; and he then adds, in words of wonderful
prescience, “<i>Where Slavery exists, the republican
theory becomes still more fallacious</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> This was written
in April, 1787, before the meeting of the Convention
that formed the National Constitution. Here is the
origin of the very clause in question. The danger which
this statesman foresaw is now upon us. When a State
fails to maintain a republican government, <i>with officers
sworn according to requirement of the Constitution</i>, it
ceases to be a constitutional State. The very case contemplated
by the Constitution has arrived, and the National
Government is invested with plenary powers,
whether of peace or war. There is nothing in the storehouse
of peace, and there is nothing in the arsenal of war,
it may not employ in the maintenance of this solemn
guaranty, and in the extension of that protection against
invasion to which it is pledged. But this extraordinary
power carries with it corresponding duty. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
shows itself dangerous to a republican form of government
must be removed without delay or hesitation; and
if the evil be Slavery, our action will be bolder when it
is known that the danger was foreseen.</p>

<p>In reviewing these three sources of power, I know
not which is most complete. Either is ample alone;
but the three together are three times ample. Thus out
of this triple fountain, or, if you please, by this triple
cord, do I educe the power of Congress over the vacated
States.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are yet other words of the Constitution which
cannot be forgotten. “New States may be admitted by
the Congress into this Union.” Assuming that the
Rebel States are no longer <i>de facto</i> States of this Union,
but that the territory occupied by them is within the
jurisdiction of Congress, then these words become completely
applicable. It is for Congress, in such way as
it shall think best, to regulate their return to the Union,
whether in time or manner. No special form is prescribed.
But the vital act must proceed from Congress.
Here again is another testimony to that Congressional
power, which, under the Constitution, will restore the
Republic.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Against this power I have heard nothing which can
be called argument. There are objections, originating
chiefly in the baneful pretension of State Rights; but
these objections are animated by prejudice rather than
reason. Assuming the impeccability of a State, and
openly declaring that States, like kings, can do no
wrong, while, like kings, they wear “the round and top
of sovereignty,” politicians treat them with most mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
forbearance and tenderness, as if these Rebel corporations
could be dandled into loyalty. At every suggestion
of rigor, State Rights are invoked; and we are
vehemently told not to destroy the States, when all that
Congress proposes is simply to recognize the actual
condition of the States, and undertake their temporary
government by providing for the condition of political
syncope into which they have fallen, and during this
interval substitute its own constitutional powers for
the unconstitutional powers of the Rebellion. Congress
will blot no star from the flag, nor will it obliterate any
State liabilities; but it will seek, according to its duty,
in the best way, to maintain the great and real sovereignty
of the Union, by upholding the flag unsullied,
and by enforcing everywhere within its jurisdiction the
supreme law of the Constitution.</p>

<p>At the close of an argument already too long drawn
out, I shall not stop to array the considerations of reason
and expediency in behalf of this jurisdiction; nor
shall I dwell on the inevitable influence it must exercise
over Slavery, which is the motive of the Rebellion.
To my mind nothing can be clearer, as a proposition of
Constitutional Law, than that everywhere within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the National Government Slavery
is impossible. The argument is as brief as it is unanswerable.
Slavery is so odious that it can exist only
by virtue of positive law, plain and unequivocal; but
no such words can be found in the Constitution; therefore
Slavery is impossible within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the National Government. For many years I
have had this conviction, and have constantly maintained
it. I am glad to believe that it is implied, if
not expressed, in the Chicago Platform. Mr. Chase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
among our public men, is known to accept it sincerely.
Thus Slavery in the Territories is unconstitutional; but
if the Rebel territory falls under the exclusive jurisdiction
of the National Government, then Slavery becomes
impossible there. In a legal and constitutional sense,
it must die at once. The air is too pure for a slave.
I cannot doubt that this great triumph has been already
won. The moment that the States fell, Slavery fell also;
so that, even without any proclamation of the President,
Slavery ceased to have legal and constitutional existence
in every Rebel State.</p>

<p>Even if we hesitate to accept this important conclusion,
which treats Slavery within the Rebel States as
already dead in law and Constitution, it cannot be
doubted that by the extension of Congressional jurisdiction,
as now proposed, many difficulties will be removed.
Holding every acre of soil and every inhabitant
within its jurisdiction, Congress can easily do whatever
is needful within Rebel limits to assure freedom
and save society. The soil may be divided among
patriot soldiers, poor whites, and freedmen; but above
all things the inhabitants may be saved from harm.
Those citizens in the Rebel States who throughout the
darkness of the Rebellion have kept their faith will be
protected, and the freedmen rescued from hands that
threaten to cast them back into Slavery.</p>

<p>This jurisdiction, which is so completely practical, is
grandly conservative also. Had it been early recognized
that Slavery depends exclusively upon the local government,
and falls with that government, who can doubt
that every Rebel movement would have been checked?
Tennessee and Virginia would never have stirred; Maryland
and Kentucky would never have thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
stirring; there would have been no talk of neutrality
between the Constitution and the Rebellion; and every
Border State would have been fixed in loyalty.
Let it be established in advance, as an inseparable incident
to every Act of Secession, that it is not only impotent
against the National Constitution, but that, on
its occurrence, both soil and inhabitants lapse beneath
the jurisdiction of Congress, and no State will ever again
pretend to secede. The word “territory,” according to
old and quaint etymology, is said to come from <i>terreo</i>,
to terrify, because it was a bulwark against the enemy:
<i>Territorium est quidquid hostis terrendi causâ constitutum
est</i>,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>&mdash;“A territory is anything established for the
purpose of terrifying an enemy”; but I know of no
way in which our Rebel enemy would have been more
terrified than by being told that his course would inevitably
precipitate his State into a territorial condition.
Let this principle be adopted, and it will contribute
essentially to that consolidation of the Union which
was so near the heart of Washington.</p>

<p>The necessity of this principle is apparent as a restraint
upon the lawless vindictiveness and inhumanity
of the Rebel States, whether against Union men or
against freedmen. Union men in Virginia already tremble
at the thought of being delivered over to a State
government wielded by original Rebels pretending to
be patriots; but the freedmen, who have only recently
gained their birthright, are justified in keener anxiety,
lest it should be lost as soon as won. Mr. Saulsbury, a
Senator from Delaware, with most instructive frankness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
has announced in public debate what the restored State
governments will do. Assuming that the local governments
will be preserved, he predicts that in 1870 there
will be more slaves in the United States than there were
in 1860, and then unfolds the reason as follows, all of
which will be found in the “Congressional Globe.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By your Acts you attempt to free the slaves. You will
not have them among you. You leave them where they are.
Then what is to be the result? I presume that local State
governments will be preserved. If they are, if the people
have a right to make their own laws and to govern themselves,
they will not only reënslave every person that you attempt
to set free, but they will reënslave the whole race.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nor has the horrid menace of reënslavement proceeded
from the Senator from Delaware alone. It has
been uttered even by Mr. Willey, the mild Senator from
Virginia, speaking in the name of State Rights. Newspapers
have taken up and repeated the revolting strain.
That is to say, no matter what may be done for Emancipation,
whether by proclamation of the President, or
by Congress even, the State, resuming its place in the
Union, will, in the exercise of its sovereign power, reënslave
every colored person within its jurisdiction;
and this is the menace from Delaware, and even from
regenerated Western Virginia! I am obliged to Senators
for their frankness. If additional motive were
needed for the urgency with which I assert the power
of Congress, it would be found in the pretensions thus
savagely proclaimed. In the name of Heaven, let us
spare no effort to save the country from such shame,
and an oppressed people from the additional outrage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>As I quote Mr. Willey, I desire his precise words
should be understood, that the country may see the
necessity of Congressional action. In opposing Emancipation
in the District of Columbia, he depicted the
unhappy fate of the freedman.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Suppose they are emancipated, what then? Are they
freemen in fact? Will they have the rights of freemen?
Sir, such an idea is utterly fallacious. It will practically
amount to nothing. You cannot enact the slave into a freeman
by bill in Congress. A charter of his liberty may be
engrossed, enrolled, and passed into a law, with all the formalities
of legislation, <i>and still he must remain virtually a
slave</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Pursuing this same strain in a later debate on the
Confiscation Bill, which provided for Emancipation in
certain cases, the Senator said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir, what will be the necessary and inevitable result of
this policy, if it be carried into effect? It will be that Virginia,
by this increase of the free negro population under
the operation of this bill, will be driven not only to reënslave
those who may be manumitted under the operation of
the present bill, but also to reënslave the sixty thousand
free negroes already there.… Sir, the evil will be unendurable,
and the result will be the reënslavement of the
slaves thus manumitted, as well as those already free in our
State.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I quote these words with extreme pain. Their author
is not known as a fanatic of Slavery. Therefore do they
reveal the terrible peril against which Congress must
provide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Once free, always free.” This is a rule of law and
an instinct of humanity. It is a self-evident axiom,
which only tyrants and slave-traders have denied. The
brutal pretension thus flamingly advanced already puts
us all on our guard. There must be no chance or loophole
for such intolerable, Heaven-defying iniquity.
Alas! there have been crimes in human history, but
I know of none blacker than this. There have been
acts of baseness, but I know of none more utterly vile.
Against the possibility of such a sacrifice we must take
a bond which cannot be set aside; and this can be
found only in the powers of Congress.</p>

<p>Congress has already done much. Besides its noble
Act of Emancipation, it has provided that every person
guilty of treason, or of inciting or assisting the Rebellion,
shall be “disqualified to hold any office under the
United States”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>; and by another Act it has provided,
that every person, elected or appointed to any office of
honor or profit under the Government of the United
States, shall, before entering upon its duties, <i>take and
subscribe an oath or affirmation</i> that he has “never voluntarily
borne arms against the United States since he
has been a citizen thereof,” or “voluntarily given aid,
countenance, counsel, or encouragement to persons engaged
in armed hostility thereto,” or “sought, or accepted,
or attempted to exercise the functions of any office
whatever, under any authority or pretended authority
in hostility to the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> This oath is a bar
against return to <i>national office</i> of any taking part with
the Rebels. It shuts out in advance the whole criminal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
company. But these same persons, rejected by the National
Government, are left free to hold office in the
States; and here is another motive to further action
by Congress. The oath is well as far as it goes; more
must be done in the same spirit.</p>

<p>But enough. The case is clear. Behold the Rebel
States in arms against that paternal government to
which, as the supreme condition of constitutional existence,
they owe duty and love; and behold all legitimate
powers, executive, legislative, and judicial, in these States,
abandoned and vacated. <i>It only remains that Congress
should enter and assume the proper jurisdiction.</i> If we
are not ready to exclaim with Burke, speaking of revolutionary
France, “It is but an empty space on the political
map,” we may at least adopt the response hurled
back by Mirabeau, that this empty space is a volcano
red with flames and overflowing with lava-floods. But
whether we deal with it as “empty space” or as “volcano,”
the jurisdiction, civil and military, centres in
Congress, to be employed for the happiness, welfare,
and renown of the American people,&mdash;changing Slavery
into Freedom, and present Chaos into a Cosmos of
perpetual beauty and power.</p>

<h2><a name="BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_AND_JOHN_SLIDELL" id="BENJAMIN_FRANKLIN_AND_JOHN_SLIDELL"></a>BENJAMIN FRANKLIN AND JOHN SLIDELL
AT PARIS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Article in the Atlantic Monthly, November, 1863.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>This article appeared originally under the title, “Monograph from
an Old Note-Book.” Beyond the curiosity of the discussion was the
object, at a critical moment, of contrasting the diplomatic representative
of our fathers at Paris and that of Rebel Slavery, with a new
appeal to France. It was in the same vein with the recent speech on
Our Foreign Relations.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">In a famous speech, made in the House of Lords,
March 6, 1838, against the Eastern slave-trade, Lord
Brougham arrests the current of his eloquence by the
following illustrative diversion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have often heard it disputed among critics, which of
all quotations was the most appropriate, the most closely
applicable to the subject-matter illustrated; <i>and the palm
is generally awarded to that which applied to Dr. Franklin
the line in Claudian</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Eripuit fulmen cœlo, mox sceptra tyrannis’;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">yet still there is a difference of opinion, and even that citation,
admirably close as it is, has rivals.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The British orator errs in attributing this remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
verse to Claudian, misled, perhaps, by reminiscence of
like-sounding words by that poet,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Rapiat fulmen sceptrumque Typhœus.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And he errs also in the quotation of the verse itself,
which he fails to give with entire accuracy. And this
double mistake becomes more noticeable, when it appears
in the carefully prepared collection of speeches, revised
at leisure, and preserved in permanent volumes.</p>

<p>The beauty of this verse, even in its least accurate
form, will not be questioned, especially as applied to
Franklin, who, before the American Revolution, in which
he performed so illustrious a part, had already awakened
the world’s admiration by drawing the lightning from the
skies. But, beyond its acknowledged beauty, this verse
has an historic interest which has never been adequately
appreciated. Appearing at the moment it did, it is
closely associated with the acknowledgment of American
Independence. Plainly interpreted, it calls George the
Third “tyrant,” and announces that the sceptre has been
snatched from his hands. It was a happy ally to Franklin
in France, and has ever since been an inspiring voice.
Latterly it has been adopted by the city of Boston, and
engraved on granite in letters of gold, in honor of its
greatest son and citizen. It may not be entirely superfluous
to recount the history of a verse which has
justly attracted so much attention, and in the history
of Civilization has been of more value than the whole
State of South Carolina.</p>

<p>From its first application to Franklin, this verse has
excited something more than curiosity. Lord Brougham
tells us that it is often discussed in private circles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
There is other evidence of the interest it has created.
For instance, in an early number of “Notes and Queries,”
is the following inquiry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Can you inform me who wrote the line on Franklin,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

</div>

<p>A subsequent writer in this same work, after calling
the verse “a parody” of a certain line of Antiquity,
says: “I am unable, however, to say who adapted these
words to Franklin’s career. Was it Condorcet?”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Another
writer in the same work says: “The inscription

<p>I remember well a social entertainment in Boston,
where a distinguished scholar of our country,<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> in reply
to an inquiry at the table, said that the verse was
founded on a line from the “Astronomicon” of Manilius,
which he repeated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“Eripuitque Jovi fulmen, viresque tonandi.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">John Quincy Adams, who was present, seemed to concur.
Mr. Sparks, in his notes to the correspondence of
Franklin, attributes to it the same origin.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But there
are other places where its origin is traced with more
precision. One of the correspondents of “Notes and
Queries” says that he has read, but does not remember
where, “that this line was <i>immediately</i> taken from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
in the ‘Anti-Lucretius’ of Cardinal Polignac.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Another
correspondent shows the intermediate authority.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
My own notes were made without any knowledge of
these studies, which, while fixing its literary origin, fail
to exhibit its important character, especially as illustrating
an historical epoch.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The verse cannot be found in any ancient writer,&mdash;not
Claudian or anybody else. It is clear that it does
not come from Antiquity, unless indirectly; nor does it
appear that at the time of its first production it was
referred to any ancient writer. Manilius was not mentioned.
It is of modern invention, and was composed
after the arrival of Franklin in Paris on his eventful
mission. At first it was anonymous, but was attributed
sometimes to D’Alembert and sometimes to Turgot.
Beyond question, it was not the production of D’Alembert,
while it is found in the Works of Turgot, published
after his death, in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Eripuit cœlo fulmen, sceptrumque tyrannis.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no explanation by the editor of the circumstances
under which the verse was written; but it is
given among poetical miscellanies of the author, immediately
after a translation into French of Pope’s “Essay
on Man,” in connection with the following French composition,
entitled “Verses beneath the Portrait of Benjamin
Franklin”:&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Le voilà ce mortel dont l’heureuse industrie</div>
<div class="verse">Sut enchaîner la Foudre et lui donner des loix,</div>
<div class="verse">Dont la sagesse active et l’éloquente voix</div>
<div class="verse">D’un pouvoir oppresseur affranchit sa Patrie,</div>
<div class="verse">Qui désarma les Dieux, qui réprime les Rois.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The single Latin verse is a marvellous substitute for
these diffuse and feeble lines.</p>

<p>If there were any doubt upon its authorship, it would
be removed by the positive statement of Condorcet, who,
in his Life of Turgot, written shortly after the death of
this great man, says: “There is known from Turgot but
one Latin verse, designed for the portrait of Franklin”;
and he gives the verse in this form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Eripuit cœlo fulmen, mox sceptra tyrannis.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></div>

<p class="noindent">But Sparks and Mignet,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and so also both the biographical
dictionaries of France,&mdash;that of Michaud and that
of Didot,&mdash;while ascribing it to Turgot, concur in the
form already quoted from Turgot’s Works, which was
likewise adopted by Ginguené, the scholar who has done
so much to illustrate Italian literature, on the title-page
of his “Science du Bon-Homme Richard,” with
an abridged Life of Franklin, in 1794, and by Cabanis,
who lived in such intimacy with Franklin.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> It cannot
be doubted that this was the final form the verse assumed,&mdash;as
it is unquestionably the best.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This verse was no common event. It was a new
expression of the French alliance, and an assurance of
independence. After its appearance and general adoption,
there was no retreat for France.</p>

<p>To appreciate its importance in marking and helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
a great epoch, certain dates must be borne in mind.
Franklin reached Paris on his mission towards the close
of 1776. He had already signed the Declaration of
Independence, and his present duty was to obtain the
recognition of France for the new power. The very
clever Madame du Deffand, in her amusing correspondence
with Horace Walpole, describes him in a visit to
her “with a fur cap on his head and spectacles on
his nose,” in the same small circle with Madame de
Luxembourg, a great lady of the time, the Abbé Barthélemy,
and the Duc de Choiseul, late Prime-Minister.
This was on the 31st of December, 1776.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> A pretty
good beginning. More than a year of effort and anxiety
ensued, brightened at last by the Burgoyne surrender
at Saratoga. On the 6th of February, 1778, the
work of the American Plenipotentiary was crowned
by the signature of the two Treaties of Alliance and
Commerce, by which France acknowledged our independence
and pledged her belligerent support. On the
13th of March, one of these treaties, with a diplomatic
note announcing that the Colonies were free and independent
States, was communicated to the British Government,
at London, which promptly encountered it by
a declaration of war. On the 20th of March, Franklin
was received by the King at Versailles, and this remarkable
scene is described by the same feminine pen
to which we are indebted for the early glimpse of him
on his arrival in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> But throughout this intervening
period he had not lived unknown. Indeed, he
had become at once a celebrity. Lacretelle, the eminent
French historian, says: “By the effect which Franklin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
produced in France he might have been said to have
fulfilled his mission, not to a court, but to a free people.…
His virtues and renown negotiated for him.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>Condorcet, who was part of that intellectual society
which welcomed the new Plenipotentiary, has left a record
of his reception. “The celebrity of Franklin in the
sciences,” he says, “gave him the friendship of all who
love or cultivate them, that is, of all who exert a real
and durable influence upon public opinion. At his arrival
he became an object of veneration to all enlightened
men, and of curiosity to others. He submitted to
this curiosity with the natural facility of his character,
and with the conviction that he thereby served the
cause of his country. It was an honor to have seen
him. People repeated what they had heard him say.
Every <i>fête</i> which he was willing to receive, every house
where he consented to go, spread in society new admirers,
<i>who became so many partisans of the American Revolution</i>.…
Men whom the reading of philosophical books
had secretly disposed to the love of Liberty became enthusiastic
for that of a strange people.… A general
cry was soon raised in favor of the American War, and
the friends of peace dared not even complain that peace
was sacrificed to the cause of Liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> This is an animated
picture by an eye-witness. But all authorities
concur in its truthfulness. Even Capefigue, whose business
is to belittle all that is truly great, and especially
to efface the names associated with human liberty, while,
like another Old Mortality, he furbishes the tombstones
of royal mistresses, is yet constrained to attest the popularity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and influence which Franklin achieved. The
critic dwells on what he styles his “Quaker garb,” his
“linen so white under his brown clothes,” and also the
elaborate art of the philosopher, who understood France
and knew well “that a popular man became soon more
powerful than power itself”; but he cannot deny that
the philosopher “fulfilled his duties with great superiority,”
or that he became at once famous.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The rosewater
biographer of Diane de Poitiers, Madame de Pompadour,
and Madame du Barry would naturally disparage the
representative of Science and Revolution.</p>

<p>From other quarters proceeds concurring testimony.
A correspondent at Paris wrote: “He now engrosses the
whole attention of the public. People of all ranks pay
their court to him. His affability and complaisant behavior
have gained him the esteem of the greatest people
in this kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> Another wrote a little later: “When
Dr. Franklin appears abroad, it is more like a public
than a private gentleman, and the curiosity of the people
to see him is so great that he may be said to be followed
by a genteel mob.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> His mysterious power was
asserted by an American newspaper, in announcing his
intention “shortly to produce an electrical machine of
such wonderful force, that, instead of giving a slight
stroke to the elbows of fifty or a hundred thousand men
who are joined hand in hand, it will give a violent shock
even to Nature herself, so as to disunite kingdoms, join
islands to continents, and render men of the same nation
strangers and enemies to each other.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
paper which spoke of him as “the old fox” acknowledged
his power.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The influence of Franklin was great beyond that of
any American in Europe since. His presence gave character
to the cause he represented, and was a standing
recommendation of our country. Jefferson, who served
two years with him at Paris, describes his influence
there, and, in reply to the charge of subservience, says,
in pregnant words: “He possessed the confidence of
that Government in the highest degree, insomuch that
it may truly be said that they were more under his
influence than he under theirs. The fact is, that his
temper was so amiable and conciliatory, his conduct
so rational, never urging impossibilities, or even things
unreasonably inconvenient to them, in short, so moderate
and attentive to their difficulties, as well as our
own, that what his enemies called subserviency I saw
was only that reasonable disposition which, sensible
that advantages are not all to be on one side, yielding
what is just and liberal, is the more certain of obtaining
liberality and justice.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> It is easy to see how such a
character obtained from the French people the fame of
snatching the sceptre from the tyrant.</p>

<p>The arrival of Franklin was followed very soon by
the departure of the youthful Lafayette, who crossed the
sea to offer his inspired sword to the service of American
Liberty. Our cause was now widely known. In the
thronged <i>cafés</i> and the places of public resort it was discussed
with sympathy and admiration.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> And so completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
was Franklin recognized as the representative of
new ideas, that the Emperor Joseph the Second of Austria,
professed reformer as he was, visiting France under
the travelling name of Count Falkenstein, is reported
to have remarked, when asked to see him, “My business
is to be a royalist,”&mdash;thus doing homage to the
real character of him in whom the Republic was personified.</p>

<p>Franklin became at once, by natural attraction, the
welcome guest of that brilliant company of philosophers
who exercised such influence over the eighteenth century.
The “Encyclopédie” was their work, and they
were masters at the Academy. He was received into
their guild. At the famous table of the Baron D’Holbach,
where twice a week, Sunday and Thursday, at dinner,
lasting from two till seven o’clock, were gathered the
wits of the time, he found a hospitable chair. But he
was most at home with Madame Helvétius, the widow
of the rich and handsome philosopher, whose name, derived
from Switzerland, is now almost unknown. At her
house he met in social familiarity D’Alembert, Diderot,
D’Holbach, Morellet, Cabanis, and Condorcet, with their
compeers. There, also, was Turgot, greatest of all. There
was another, famous in some respects as any of these,
but leading a different life, whom Franklin saw often,&mdash;Caron
Beaumarchais, author already of the “Barbier de
Séville,” as he was afterwards of the “Mariage de Figaro,”
who, turning aside from an unsurpassed success
at the theatre, exerted his peculiar genius to enlist the
French Government on the side of the struggling Colonies,
predicted their triumph, and at last, under the assumed
name of a mercantile house, became the agent
of the Comte de Vergennes in furnishing clandestine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
supplies of arms before the recognition of independence.
It is supposed that through this popular dramatist
Franklin maintained communications with the French
Government until the mask was thrown aside.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beyond all doubt, Turgot is one of the most remarkable
intelligences that France has produced. He was
by nature a philosopher and a reformer; but he was also
a statesman, with a seat in the Cabinet of Louis the
Sixteenth, first as Minister of the Marine, and then as
Comptroller-General of the Finances. Perhaps no minister
ever studied more completely the good of the people.
His administration was one constant benefaction.
But he was too good for the age,&mdash;or, rather, the age
was not good enough for him. The King was induced
to part with him, forgetting his earlier words, “You and
I are the only two persons who really love the people.”
This was some time in May, 1776; so that Franklin, on
his arrival, found this eminent Frenchman free from
all constraints of ministerial position. The character of
Turgot shows how naturally he sympathized with the
Colonies struggling for independence, especially when
represented by a person like Franklin. In a prize essay
of his youth, written in 1750, when he was only
twenty-three years of age, he foretold the American
Revolution. These are his remarkable words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Colonies are like fruits, which hold to the tree only till
their maturity. Having become sufficient to themselves,
they do that which Carthage did, <i>that which America will
one day do</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>One of his last acts before leaving the Ministry was
to prepare a memoir on the American War, for the information
and at the request of the King, where he says,
that “the idea of the absolute separation of the Colonies
and the mother country seems infinitely probable,&mdash;that,
when the independence of the Colonies shall be entire
and acknowledged by the English themselves, there will
be a total revolution in the political and commercial relations
of Europe and America,&mdash;and that all the parent
states will be forced to abandon all empire over their
colonies, to leave them entire liberty of commerce with
all nations, and to be content in sharing with others this
liberty, and in preserving with their colonies the bonds
of amity and fraternity.”<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> This memoir of the French
statesman bears date the 6th of April, 1776, nearly three
months before the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Leaving the Ministry, Turgot devoted himself to literature,
science, and charity, translating Odes of Horace
and portions of Virgil, studying geometry with Bossut,
chemistry with Lavoisier, astronomy with Rochon, and
interesting himself in everything by which human welfare
is advanced. Such a character, with such experience
of government, and the prophet of American independence,
was naturally prepared to welcome Franklin,
not only as philosopher, but also as statesman.</p>

<p>The classical welcome was partially anticipated,&mdash;at
least in an unsuccessful attempt. Baron Grimm, in that
interesting and instructive “Correspondance,” prepared
originally for the advantage of distant courts, but now
constituting a literary and social monument of the period,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
mentions, under date of October, 1777, that the
following French verses were made for the portrait of
Franklin by Cochin, engraved by St. Aubin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“C’est l’honneur et l’appui du nouvel hémisphère;</div>
<div class="verse">Les flots de l’Océan s’abaissent à sa voix;</div>
<div class="verse">Il réprime ou dirige à son gré le tonnerre:</div>
<div class="verse">Qui désarme les dieux, peut-il craindre les rois?”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These lines seem to contain the very idea in the verse
of Turgot. But they were suppressed at the time by
the censor, on the ground that they were “blasphemous,”
although it is added in a note that “they concerned
only the King of England.” Was it that the negotiations
with Franklin were not yet sufficiently advanced?
And here mark the dates.</p>

<p>It was only after the communication to Great Britain
of the Treaty of Alliance and the reception of Franklin
at Versailles, that the seal seems to have been broken.
Baron Grimm, in his “Correspondance,” under date of
April, 1778, makes the following entry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A very beautiful Latin verse has been made for the portrait
of Dr. Franklin,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Eripuit cœlo fulmen, sceptrumque tyrannis.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It is a happy imitation of a verse of the ‘Anti-Lucretius,’&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Eripuitque Jovi fulmen, Phœboque sagittas.’”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Here is the earliest notice of this verse, authenticating
its origin. Nothing further is said of the “Anti-Lucretius”;
for in that day it was familiar to every lettered
person. But I shall speak of it before I close.</p>

<p>Only a few days later the verse appears in the correspondence
of Madame D’Épinay, whose intimate relations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
with Baron Grimm&mdash;the subject of curiosity and
scandal&mdash;will explain her early knowledge of it. She
records it in a letter to the very remarkable Italian
Abbé Galiani, under date of May 3, 1778. And she
proceeds to give a translation in French verse, which
she says “D’Alembert made the other morning on waking.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
Galiani, who was himself a master of Latin versification,
and followed closely the fortunes of America,
must have enjoyed the tribute. In a letter written
shortly afterwards, he enters into all the grandeur of
the occasion. “You have,” says he, “at this hour decided
the greatest revolution of the globe,&mdash;the question
whether America shall rule Europe, or Europe shall
continue to rule America. I would wager in favor of
America.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> In these words the Neapolitan said as much
as Turgot.</p>

<p>I cannot quote Galiani without adding that nobody
saw America with more prophetic eye than this inspired
Pulcinello of Naples. As far back as May 18, 1776,
several weeks even before the Declaration of Independence,
and much longer before it was known in Europe,
he wrote: “The epoch is come for the total fall of Europe
and for transmigration to America.… Do not,
then, buy your house in the Chaussée d’Antin, but at
Philadelphia. The misfortune for me is that there are
no abbeys in America.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Once a favorite in the very
circle where Franklin was welcomed, he left Paris for
Italy before the arrival of the negotiator, so that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
knew the tribute only through a faithful correspondence.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the verse appears in a different
scene. It had reached the <i>salons</i> of Madame Doublet,
whence it was transferred to the “Mémoires Secrets”
of Bachaumont, under date of June 8, 1778, as “a very
beautiful verse, quite proper to characterize M. Franklin
and to serve as an inscription for his portrait.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> These
Memoirs, as is well known, are the record of news and
town-talk gathered in the circle of that venerable Egeria
of gossip;<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and here is evidence of the publicity this
welcome had promptly obtained.</p>

<p>The verse was now fairly launched. War was flagrant
between France and Great Britain. No longer was
there any reason why the new alliance between France
and the United States should not be placed under the
auspices of genius, and why the same hand that had
snatched the lightning from the skies should not have
the fame of snatching the sceptre from King George the
Third. The time for free speech had come. It was no
longer “blasphemous.”</p>

<p>It will be observed that these records of this verse
fail to mention the immediate author. Was he unknown
at the time? or did the fact that he was recently a
Cabinet Minister induce him to hide behind a mask?
Turgot was a master of epigram,&mdash;as witness the terrible
lines on Frederick of Prussia;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> but he was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
prudent in conduct. “Nobody,” said Voltaire, “so skilful
to launch the shaft without showing the hand.”
There is a letter from no less a person than D’Alembert,
which reveals something of the “filing” which the verse
underwent, and something of the persons consulted. Unhappily,
the letter is without date; nor does it appear
to whom it was addressed, except that the “<i>cher confrère</i>”
seems to imply that it was to a brother of the
Academy. This letter is found in a work now known
to have been the compilation of the Marquis Gaëtan
de la Rochefoucauld,<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> entitled “Mémoires de Condorcet
sur la Révolution Française, extraits de sa Correspondance
et de celles de ses Amis,” and is introduced
by the following words from the Marquis:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is known how Franklin was fêted when he came
to Paris, because he was the representative of a republic.
The philosophers, especially, received him with enthusiasm.
It may be said, among other things, that D’Alembert lost
his sleep; and we are going to prove it by a letter which he
wrote, while racking his brain to versify in honor of Franklin.”</p>

</div>

<p>The letter is then given as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Friday Morning.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Colleague</span>,&mdash; … You are acquainted with
the Franklin verse,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Eripuit cœlo fulmen, <i>mox sceptra</i> tyrannis.’</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">You should surely cause it to be put in the Paris paper, if
it is not there already.</p>

<p>“I am inclined to agree with La Harpe that <i>sceptrumque</i>
is better: first, because <i>mox sceptra</i> is a little hard, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>because <i>mox</i>, according to the dictionary of Gesner, who
adduces examples, signifies equally <i>statim</i> or <i>deinde</i>, which
makes an ambiguity, <i>mox eripuit</i> or <i>mox eripiet</i>.</p>

<p>“Be that as it may, here is how I have attempted to

<p>From this letter it appears that the critical judgment
of La Harpe, confirmed by D’Alembert, sided for <i>sceptrumque</i>
as better than <i>mox sceptra</i>.</p>

<p>The verse of Turgot was not alone in its testimony.
An incident precisely contemporaneous shows how completely
France had fallen under the fascination of the
American cause. Voltaire, the acknowledged chief of
French literature in the brilliant eighteenth century,
after many years of busy exile at Ferney, in the neighborhood
of Geneva, where he had wielded his far-reaching
sceptre, was induced in old age to visit Paris once
again before he died. He left his Swiss retreat on the
6th of February, 1778, the very day on which Franklin
signed the alliance with France, and, after a journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
which resembled the progress of a sovereign, reached
Paris on the 10th of February. He was at once surrounded
by the homage of all most illustrious in literature
and science, while the Theatre, grateful for his
contributions, vied with the Academy. There were two
characters on whom the patriarch, as he was fondly
called, lavished a homage of his own. He had already
addressed to Turgot a most remarkable epistle in verse,
the mood of which may be seen in its title, “Épître à
un Homme”; but on seeing the discarded statesman,
who had been so true to benevolent ideas, he came forward
to meet him, saying, with his whole soul, “Let
me kiss the hand which signed the salvation of the people.”
The scene with Franklin was more touching still.
Voltaire began in English, which he had spoken early
in life, but, having lost the habit, soon changed to
French, saying that he “could not resist the desire of
speaking for one moment the language of Franklin.”
The latter had brought with him his grandson, for whom
he asked a benediction. “God and Liberty,” said Voltaire,
putting his hands upon the head of the child;
“this is the only benediction proper for the grandson of
Franklin.” A few weeks afterward, at a public session
of the Academy, they were placed side by side, when,
amidst the applause of the enlightened company, the
two old men rose and embraced. The political triumphs
of Franklin and the dramatic triumphs of Voltaire caused
the exclamation, “Solon and Sophocles embrace!” It was
more than this. It was France and America embracing
beneath the benediction of “God and Liberty.” Only
a month later Voltaire died. But the alliance with
France had received new assurance, and the cause of
American independence an immutable impulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Turgot did not live to enjoy the final triumph to
which he had given such remarkable expression. He
died March 20, 1781, several months before that “crowning
mercy,” the capture of Cornwallis, and nearly two
years before the Provisional Articles of Peace, by which
the Colonies were recognized as free and independent
States. But his attachment to Franklin was one of
the enjoyments of his latter years.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Besides the verse
to which so much reference has been made, there is an
interesting incident attesting the communion of ideas
between them, if not the direct influence of Turgot.
Captain Cook, the eminent navigator, who “steered
Britain’s oak into a world unknown,” was in distant
seas on a voyage of discovery. Such an enterprise naturally
interested Franklin, and, in the spirit of a refined
humanity, he sought to save it from the chances of war.
Accordingly, he issued a passport, addressed “To all
captains and commanders of armed ships acting by
commission from the Congress of the United States of
America, now in war with Great Britain,” where, after
setting forth the nature of the voyage of the English
navigator, he proceeded to say:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span> “This is most
earnestly to recommend to every one of you, that, in
case the said ship, which is now expected to be soon
in the European seas on her return, should happen to
fall into your hands, you would not consider her as
an enemy, nor suffer any plunder to be made of the
effects contained in her, nor obstruct her immediate
return to England by detaining her or sending her into
any other part of Europe or to America, but that you
would treat the said Captain Cook and his people with
all civility and kindness, affording them, as common
friends to mankind, all the assistance in your power
which they may happen to stand in need of.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> This
document bears date March 10, 1779. But Turgot had
anticipated Franklin. At the first menace of war he
had submitted a memoir to the French Government,
on which it was ordered that Captain Cook should not
be treated as an enemy, but as a benefactor of all European
nations.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> Here was a triumph of Civilization by
which we, too, have been gainers; for such an example
is universal and immortal in influence.</p>

<p>There is yet another circumstance which should be
mentioned as revealing an identity of sympathies in
these two eminent persons. Each sought to marry
Madame Helvétius: Turgot early in life, while she was
still Mademoiselle Ligniville, belonging to a family of
twenty-one children, from a château in Lorraine, and
a niece of Madame de Graffigny, author of the “Peruvian
Letters”; Franklin in his old age, while a welcome
guest in the intellectual company which this widowed
lady continued to gather about her at Auteuil, in the
neighborhood of Paris, and not far from his own house
at Passy. Throughout his stay in France he continued
in unbroken relations with this circle, dining with it
very often, and adding much to its gayety, while Madame
Helvétius, with her friends, dined with him once
a week. It was with tears in his eyes that he parted
from her, whom he never expected to see again in this
life; and on reaching his American home he addressed
her in words of touching tenderness:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> “I stretch out my
arms towards you, notwithstanding the immensity of
the seas which separate us, while I wait the heavenly
kiss which I firmly trust one day to give you.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a></p>

<p>In the permanent group about Madame Helvétius
were Cabanis and Morellet, both living for many years
under her hospitable roof. To the former we are indebted
for the interesting extract last quoted. The
intimacy with Franklin is attested in other ways. Nobody
who has visited the Imperial<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> Library at Paris
can forget his very pleasant autograph note in French
concerning Madame Helvétius, exhibited in the same
case with an autograph note of Henry the Fourth to
Gabrielle d’Estrées.</p>

<p>Another glimpse is furnished by Mrs. Adams, who, in
her family correspondence, reports a scene at the house
of Franklin. “The Doctor entered at one door, she
[Madame Helvétius] at the other; upon which she
ran forward to him, caught him by the hand, ‘Hélas,
Franklin!’&mdash;then gave him a double kiss, one upon each
cheek, and another upon his forehead.… She carried
on the chief of the conversation at dinner, frequently
locking her hand into the Doctor’s.” Franklin spoke of
her as “a genuine Frenchwoman, wholly free from affectation
or stiffness of behavior, and one of the best
women in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Madame Helvétius died at
Auteuil, August 12, 1800, aged eighty-one, and, according
to her desire, was buried in her garden. A few
years later the same house became the home of Benjamin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Thompson, Count Rumford, who died there, and
was buried in the neighboring cemetery.</p>

<p>But the story of the verse is not yet finished. And
here it mingles with the history of Franklin in Paris,
constituting an episode of the American Revolution.
The verse was written for a portrait. And now that
the costly first step had been taken, the portrait of
Franklin was seen everywhere,&mdash;in painting, in sculpture,
and in engraving. I have counted in the superb
collection of the Bibliothèque Impériale, at Paris, forty-seven
engraved heads of him. At the royal exhibition
of pictures the republican portrait found place, and the
name of Franklin was printed at length in the catalogue,&mdash;a
circumstance which did not pass unobserved at the
time; for the “Espion Anglais,” in recording it, treats
it as “announcing that he began to come out of his
obscurity.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The same curious authority, describing a
festival at Marseilles, says, under date of March 20,
1779, “I was struck, on entering the hall, to observe
a crowd of portraits representing the insurgents; but
that of M. Franklin especially drew my attention, on
account of the device, ‘<i>Eripuit cœlo fulmen, sceptrumque
tyrannis</i>.’ This was inscribed recently, and <i>every one
admired the sublime truth</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Thus completely was
France, not merely in its social centre, where fashion
gives the law, but in its distant borders, pledged to the
cause of which Franklin was the representative.</p>

<p>As in halls of science and popular resorts, so was our
Plenipotentiary even in the palace of princes. The
biographer of the Prince de Condé dwells with admiration
upon the illustrious character, who, during the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
debate and the negotiations that ensued, had fixed the
regards of Paris, of Versailles, of the whole kingdom indeed,&mdash;although
in simple and farmer-like exterior, so
unlike those gilded plenipotentiaries to whom France
was accustomed,&mdash;and he recounts, most sympathetically,
that the Prince, after an interview of two hours,
declared that “Franklin appeared to him above even his
reputation.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> And here we encounter again the unwilling
testimony of Capefigue, who says that he was
followed everywhere, taking possession of “hearts and
minds,” and that “his picture, in his simple Quaker
dress, was suspended at the hearth of the poor and in
the boudoir of the fashionable,”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>&mdash;all of which is in
harmony with the more sympathetic record of Lacretelle,
who says that “portraits of Franklin were to be
seen everywhere, with this inscription, <i>which the Court
itself found just and sublime</i>, ‘<i>Eripuit cœlo fulmen, sceptrumque
tyrannis</i>.’”<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>Fragonard, the King’s painter, united in this adulation.
A French paper describes the artist as displaying
his utmost efforts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> “in an elegant picture dedicated
to the genius of Franklin, who is represented with one
hand opposing the ægis of Minerva to the thunderbolt,
which he first knew how to fix by his conductors, and
with the other commanding the God of War to fight
against Avarice and Tyranny, whilst America, nobly reclining
upon him, and holding in her hand the fasces,
true emblem of the union of the American States, looks
down with tranquillity on her defeated enemies.” It is
then said, that “the painter, in this picture, most beautifully
expressed the idea of the Latin verse which has
been so justly applied to M. Franklin.” The enthusiastic
journalist, not content with the picture and the verse,
proceeded to claim him as of French ancestry. “Franklin
appears rather to be of French than of English origin.
It is certain that the name of Franklin, or Franquelin,
is very common in Picardy, especially in the districts of
Vimeux and Ponthieu. It is very probable that one of
the Doctor’s ancestors was an inhabitant of this country,
and went over to England with the fleet of Jean de
Biencourt, or that which was fitted out by the nobility
of this province.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> The story of Homer seems revived.</p>

<p>The tribute of Madame d’Houdetot was most peculiar.
This lady, one of the riddles of French society in the
eighteenth century, whom Rousseau depicted in a passage
of surpassing fervor and made the inspiration of his
“Nouvelle Éloïse,” received Franklin at her château,
near Paris, in a brilliant circle, with banquet and verses
in his honor. The famous guest, at his arrival, and then
at dinner, with every glass of wine was saluted by a new
verse, the whole ending with the ascription of Turgot.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
Whether to admire or pity the philosopher on this occasion
is the question.</p>

<p>In the minds of Frenchmen Franklin was associated
always with this verse; but such association was no
common fame. The Marquis de Chastellux, while on
board the French frigate in the Chesapeake Bay, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
which he was about to leave, after those travels which
did so much to make our country known in Europe,
addressed a communication to Professor Madison, of
Virginia, on the fine arts in America, where he recommends
for all the great towns a portrait of Franklin,
“with the Latin verse inscribed in France below his
portrait.”<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> Thus, while teaching our fathers the homage
due to the great citizen, the generous Frenchman
did not forget the testimony of his countryman.</p>

<p>French invention stopped not with Turgot. Other
verses were pitched on the same key. An engraving
of Franklin by Chevillet, after a portrait by Duplessis,
has this tribute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Honneur du Nouveau Monde et de l’Humanité,</div>
<div class="verse">Ce Sage aimable et vrai les guide et les éclaire;</div>
<div class="verse">Comme un autre Mentor, il cache à l’œil vulgaire,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Sous les traits d’un mortel, une Divinité.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Under another engraving, by F. N. Martinet, where
Franklin is seated in a chair, are these lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“Il a ravi le feu des cieux,</div>
<div class="verse">Il fait fleurir les arts en des climats sauvages;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">L’Amérique le place à la tête des sages,</div>
<div class="verse">La Grèce l’auroit mis au nombre de ses Dieux.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was at Court, even in the palatial precincts of Versailles,
that the portrait and its famous inscription had
their most remarkable experience. Of this there is authentic
account in the Memoirs of Marie Antoinette
by her attendant, Madame Campan. This feminine
chronicler relates that Franklin appeared at court in
the dress of an American farmer. His flat hair without
powder, his round hat, his coat of brown cloth contrasted
with the bespangled and embroidered dresses, the powdered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
and perfumed coiffures of the courtiers. The novelty
charmed the lively imagination of the French ladies.
Elegant <i>fêtes</i> were given to the man who was
said to unite in himself the renown of one of the greatest
of natural philosophers with “those patriotic virtues
which had made him embrace the noble part of Apostle
of Liberty.” Madame Campan records that she assisted
at one of these <i>fêtes</i>, where the most beautiful among
three hundred ladies was designated to place a crown
of laurel upon the white head of the American philosopher,
and two kisses upon the cheeks of the old man.
Even in the palace, at the exposition of the Sèvres porcelain,
the medallion of Franklin, with the legend, “<i>Eripuit
cœlo</i>,” etc., was sold directly under the eyes of the
King. Madame Campan adds, however, that the King
avoided expressing himself on this enthusiasm, which,
“without doubt, his sound sense led him to blame.” But
an incident, called “a pleasantry,” which has remained
quite unknown, goes beyond speech in explaining the
secret sentiments of Louis the Sixteenth. The Comtesse
Diane de Polignac, devoted to Marie Antoinette, shared
warmly the “infatuation” with regard to Franklin. The
King observed it. But here the story shall be told in
the language of the eminent lady who records it: “Il
fit faire à la manufacture de Sèvres un vase de nuit, au
fond duquel était placé le médaillon avec la légende <i>si
fort en vogue</i>, et l’envoya en présent d’étrennes à la Comtesse
Diane.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Such was the exceptional treatment of
Franklin, and of the inscription in his honor which was
“so much in vogue.” Giving to this incident its natural
interpretation, it is impossible to resist the conclusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
that the French people, and not the King, sanctioned
American independence.</p>

<p>The conduct of the Queen on this occasion is not recorded,
although we are told by the same communicative
chronicler, who had been her Majesty’s companion,
that she did not hesitate to express herself more openly
than the King on the part taken by France in favor of
American independence, to which she was constantly
opposed. A letter from Marie Antoinette, addressed to
Madame de Polignac, under date of April 9, 1787, declares
unavailing regret in memorable words: “The time
of illusions is past, and to-day we pay dear on account
of our infatuation and enthusiasm for the American
War.”<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Evidently, Marie Antoinette, like her brother
Joseph, thought that her “business was to be a royalist.”</p>

<p>But the name of Franklin triumphed in France. So
long as his residence continued there he was received
with honor; and when, after the achievement of independence,
and the final fulfilment of all that was declared
in the verse of Turgot, he undertook to return
home, the Queen&mdash;who had looked with so little favor
upon the cause he so grandly represented&mdash;sent a litter
to receive his sick body and carry him gently to the sea.
As the great Revolution began to show itself, his name
was hailed with new honor; and this was natural; for
the French Revolution was an outbreak of the spirit that
had risen to welcome him. In snatching the sceptre
from a tyrant he had given a lesson to France. His
death, when at last it occurred, was the occasion of a
magnificent eulogy from Mirabeau, who, borrowing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
idea of Turgot, exclaimed from the tribune of the National
Assembly, “Antiquity would have raised altars to
the powerful genius, who, to the benefit of mankind, embracing
in his thought both heaven and earth, <i>could subdue
lightning and tyrants</i>.” On his motion, France went
into mourning for Franklin.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> His bust became a favorite
ornament, and, during the festival of Liberty, it was
carried, with the busts of Sidney, Rousseau, and Voltaire,
before the people to receive their veneration.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> A
little later, the eminent medical character, Cabanis, who
had lived in intimate association with Franklin, added
his testimony, saying, that the enfranchisement of the
United States was in many respects his work, and that
the Revolution, the most important to the happiness of
men which had then been accomplished on earth, united
with one of the most brilliant discoveries of physical
science to consecrate his memory; and he concludes by
quoting the verse of Turgot.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Long afterwards, his last
surviving companion in the cheerful circle of Madame
Helvétius, still loyal to the idea of Turgot, hailed him
as “that great man who placed his country in the number
of independent states, and made one of the most
important discoveries of the age.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is time to look at this verse in its literary relations,
from which I have been diverted by its commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
import as a political event; but this naturally enhances
the interest in its origin.</p>

<p>The poem which furnished the prototype of the famous
verse was “Anti-Lucretius, sive de Deo et Natura,”
by the Cardinal Melchior de Polignac. Its author was
of that patrician house associated so closely with Marie
Antoinette in the earlier Revolution, and with Charles
the Tenth in the later Revolution, having its cradle in
the mountains of Auvergne, near the cradle of Lafayette,
and its present tomb in the historic cemetery of Picpus,
near the tomb of Lafayette, so that these two great
names, representing opposite ideas, begin and end side
by side. He was not merely author, but statesman and
diplomatist also, under Louis the Fourteenth and Fifteenth.
Through his diplomacy a French prince was
elected King of Poland. He represented France at the
Peace of Utrecht, where he bore himself very proudly
towards the Dutch. By the nomination of the Pretender,
at that time in France, he obtained the hat of
a cardinal. At Rome he was a favorite, and also at
Versailles, with some interruptions. His personal appearance,
his distinguished manners, his genius, and his
accomplishments, all commended him. Literary honors
were superadded to political and ecclesiastical. He succeeded
to the chair of Bossuet at the Academy. But he
was not without the vicissitudes of political life. Falling
into disgrace at court, he was banished to the abbacy
of Bonport. There the lettered Prince of the
Church occupied himself with a refutation of Lucretius,
in Latin verse.</p>

<p>The origin of the poem is not without interest. Meeting
Bayle in Holland, the Frenchman found the indefatigable
skeptic most persistently citing Lucretius, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
whose elaborate verse the atheistic materialism of Epicurus
is developed and exalted. Others had answered
the philosopher directly; but the indignant Christian
was moved to answer the poet through whom the dangerous
system was proclaimed. His poem was, therefore,
a vindication of God and religion, in direct response
to a master-poem of antiquity in which these are assailed.
The attempt was lofty, especially when the
champion adopted the language of Lucretius. Perhaps
no writer of Latin verse since the admired Sannazaro,
found equal success. Even before its publication, in
1747, it was read at court, and was admired in the
princely circle of Sceaux. It appeared in elegant editions,
was translated into French prose by Bougainville,
and into French verse by Jeanty-Laurans, also most
successfully into Italian verse by Ricci. At the latter
part of the last century, when Franklin reached Paris,
it was hardly less known in literary circles than a volume
of Grote’s History in our own day. Voltaire, the
contemporary arbiter of literary fame, regarding the
author only on the side of literature, said of him, in
his “Temple du Goût”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Le Cardinal, oracle de la France,</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>
<div class="verse">Réunissant Virgile avec Platon,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Vengeur du Ciel et vainqueur de Lucrèce</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The last line of this remarkable eulogy has a movement
and balance not unlike the Latin verse of Turgot, or
that which suggested it in the poem of Polignac; but
the praise it so pointedly offers attests the fame of the
author. Nor was this praise limited to the “fine frenzy”
of verse. The “Anti-Lucretius” was gravely pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
the “rival of one of the greatest poems of ancient
Rome,”&mdash;“with verses as flowing as Ovid, sometimes
approaching the elegant simplicity of Horace and
sometimes the nobleness of Virgil,”&mdash;and then again,
with a philosophy and a poetry combined which “would
not be disavowed either by Descartes or by Virgil.”<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

<p>Turning now to the poem itself, we see how completely
the verse of Turgot finds its prototype. Epicurus
is indignantly described as denying to the gods
all power, and declaring man independent, so as to act
for himself; and here the poet says: “Assailing the
thundering temples of heaven, <i>he snatched the lightning
from Jove and the arrows from Apollo</i>, and, liberating
the human race, bade it dare all things”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“Cœli et tonitralia templa lacessens,</div>
<div class="verse"><i>Eripuit fulmenque Jovi, Phœboque sagittas</i>;</div>
<div class="verse">Et mortale manumittens genus, omnia jussit</div>
<div class="verse">Audere.”<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To deny the power of God, and to declare independence
of His commands, which the poet here holds up to judgment,
is very unlike the life of Franklin, all whose service
was in obedience to God’s laws, whether in snatching
the lightning from the skies or the sceptre from
tyrants; and yet it is evident that the verse picturing
Epicurus in his impiety suggested the image of the
American plenipotentiary in his double labors of science
and statesmanship.</p>

<p>The present story will not be complete without further
reference to the poem of Antiquity supposed to
have suggested the verse of Turgot, and which doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
did suggest the verse of the “Anti-Lucretius.” Manilius
is a poet little known. It is difficult to say when
he lived or what he was. He is sometimes imagined to
have lived under Augustus, and sometimes under Theodosius.
He is sometimes imagined to have been a Roman
slave, and sometimes a Roman senator. His poem,
under the name of “Astronomicon,” is a treatise on astronomy
in verse, recounting the origin of the material
universe, exhibiting the relations of the heavenly bodies,
and vindicating this ancient science. While describing
the growth of knowledge, gradually mastering Nature,
the poet says,&mdash;</p>

<p>The meaning of this line is seen in the context, which,
for plainness as well as curiosity, I quote from a metrical

Turgot had already done it into French; so had D’Alembert.
M. Nogaret wrote to Franklin, inclosing an attempted
translation, and says in his letter: “The French
have done their best to translate this Latin verse, where
justice is done you in so few words. They have appeared
as jealous of transporting this eulogy into their language
as they are of possessing you. But nobody has succeeded,
and I think nobody will succeed.” He then quotes
a translation which he thinks defective, although it appeared
in the “Almanach des Muses” as the best:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">These verses are characteristic of that intimate circle.
<i>L’habile Benjamin!</i></p>

<p>Nothing with regard to Franklin is more curious
than the Memoirs of the long-lived Abbé,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> including
especially the humorous engraving illustrating the benevolence
of Nature in the construction of the elbow,
from a design by the lightning-and-sceptre-seizer. In
some copies this engraving is wanting. Franklin is
represented as fond especially of Scottish airs and <i>chansons
à boire</i>, which he accompanied sometimes on the
harmonica, “an instrument, as is known, of his invention.”
The scandalous whispers with regard to him,
strangely adopted by a German traveller in our country,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
had no better authority, probably, than these hilarities
and the well-known “infatuation” of the court ladies.
But the good Abbé, who saw him so freely with
the friends he loved, dwells on his exquisite social qualities,
his perfect good-nature, his simplicity of manners,
his uprightness of soul, which made itself felt in the
smallest things, his extreme tolerance, and, above all,
his sweet serenity, changing easily into gayety; and he
describes the great void made in that circle when he
left for America.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In concluding this sketch, I wish to say that the literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
associations of the subject did not tempt me; but
I could not resist the inducement to present in proper
light an interesting incident, which is truly comprehended
only when seen in its political relations. Its
history, even in details, becomes important, so that the
verse which occupied so much attention should be recognized
not only in its scholarly fascination, but in its
wide-spread influence among the learned and even the
fashionable in Paris and throughout France, binding
this great nation by an unchangeable vow to the support
of American Liberty. Words are sometimes deeds; but
never were words so completely deeds as those with
which Turgot welcomed Franklin. The memory of that
welcome cannot be forgotten in America. Can it ever
be forgotten in France?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>And now the country is amazed by the report that
the original welcome of France to America, and the inspired
welcome of Turgot to Franklin, are forgotten by
the France of this day, or, rather let me say, forgotten
by the Emperor, whose memory for the time is the
memory of France. It is said that Louis Napoleon is
concerting alliance with the Rebel Slavemongers of our
country, founded on the recognition of their independence,
so that they may take their place as a new power
in the Family of Nations. Indeed, we have been told,
through the columns of the official organ, the “Moniteur,”
that he wishes to do this thing. Can he imagine
that he follows the great example of the last century?</p>

<p>What madness!</p>

<p>The two cases are in conspicuous contrast,&mdash;as opposite
as the poles, as unlike as Liberty and Slavery.</p>

<p>The struggle for American independence was for Liberty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
and was elevated throughout by this holy cause.
But the struggle for Slavemonger independence is necessarily
and plainly for Slavery, and is degraded throughout
by the unutterable vileness of its undisguised pretensions.</p>

<p>The earlier struggle, adopted by the enlightened genius
of France, was solemnly placed under the benediction of
“God and Liberty.” The present struggle, happily thus
far discarded by that same enlightened genius, can have
no other benediction than “Satan and Slavery.”</p>

<p>The earlier struggle was to snatch the sceptre from a
kingly tyrant. The present struggle is to put whips in
the hands of Rebel Slavemongers with which <i>to compel
work without wages</i>, thus giving wicked power to vulgar
tyrants without number.</p>

<p>The earlier struggle was fitly pictured by the welcome
of Turgot to Franklin. But another feeling must be
found, and other words invented, to portray the struggle
now seeking the protection of France.</p>

<p>The earlier struggle was grandly represented by Benjamin
Franklin, who was already known by a sublime
discovery in science. The present struggle is characteristically
represented by John Slidell,<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> whose great fame
is from electioneering frauds to control a Presidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
election; so that his character is fitly drawn, when it is
said that he thrust fraudulent votes into the ballot-box,
and whips into the hands of taskmasters.</p>

<p>The earlier struggle was predicted by Turgot, who
said, that, in the course of Nature, colonies must drop
from the parent stem, like ripe fruit. But where is the
Turgot who has predicted, that, in the course of Nature,
the great Republic must be broken to found a new
power on the corner-stone of Slavery?</p>

<p>The earlier struggle gathered about it the sympathy
of the learned, the good, and the wise, while the people
of France rose up to call it blessed. The present struggle
can expect nothing but detestation from all not lost
to duty and honor, while the people of France must
cover it with curses.</p>

<p>The earlier struggle enjoyed the favor of France,
whether in assemblies of learning or of fashion, in
spite of its King. It remains to be seen if the present
struggle must not ignobly fail in France, still mindful
of its early vows, in spite of its Emperor.</p>

<p>Where duty and honor are so plain, it is painful to
think that even for a moment there can be hesitation.</p>

<p>Alas for France!</p>

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, December 21, 1863.</p>

<p class="dropcap">MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I had counted on partaking of
your patriotic, invigorating, and gratifying festival,
where New-Englanders away from home annually
meet for fellowship; but the Senate is in session, and
you know it is not a habit with me to leave my post.
I must put off to another occasion the pleasure I had
promised myself.</p>

<p>Never before, since the Mayflower landed its precious
cargo, have New-Englanders had more reason for pride
and gratulation than now. We are told that a little
leaven shall leaven the whole lump, and that saying is
verified. The principles and ideas which constitute the
strength and glory of New England have spread against
opposition and contumely, till at last their influence is
visible in a regenerated country,&mdash;tried, it may be, by
murderous conspiracy and rebellion, but aroused and
stimulated to the manly support of Human Rights.</p>

<p>Amid all the sorrows of a conflict without precedent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>let us hold fast to the consolation that it is in simple
obedience to the spirit in which New England was
founded that we are now resisting the bloody efforts
to raise a wicked power on the corner-stone of Human
Slavery, and that as New-Englanders we could not do
otherwise.</p>

<p>If such a wicked power can be raised on this continent,
the Mayflower traversed its wintry sea in vain.</p>

<p>We remember, too, that another ship crossed at the
same time, buffeting the same sea. It was a Dutch
ship, with twenty slaves, who were landed at Jamestown,
in Virginia, and became the fatal seed of that
Slavery which has threatened to overshadow the land.
Thus the same ocean, in the same year, bore to the
Western Continent the Pilgrim Fathers, consecrated to
Human Liberty, and also a cargo of slaves. In the
holds of those two ships were the germs of the present
direful war, and the simple question now is between
the Mayflower and the slave ship. Who that has not
forgotten God can doubt the result? The Mayflower
must prevail.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 8, 1864, the Senate having under consideration a bill to
amend an act entitled “An Act for enrolling and calling out the national
forces and for other purposes,” approved March 3, 1863, Mr.
Sumner moved an amendment, afterwards modified as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, in addition to the substitute furnished by a drafted person, or, where
no substitute is furnished, then in addition to the sum fixed by the Secretary
of War for the procuration of a substitute, every such drafted person shall,
before his discharge from the draft, be held to contribute a certain proportion,
in the nature of a tithe, of his annual gains, profits, or income, whether
derived from any kind of property, dividends, salary, or from any profession,
trade, or employment whatever, according to the following rates, to wit: on
all income over one thousand dollars and not over two thousand dollars, five
per centum; over two thousand dollars and not over five thousand dollars,
ten per centum; and on all income over five thousand dollars, twenty per
centum. And it shall be the duty of every such person, seeking to be discharged,
to make return, either by himself or his guardian, to the provost-marshal
of his district, of the amount of his income, according to the requirements
of the Act to provide internal revenue, of July 1, 1862. And it is further
provided, That the contribution thus made shall be employed by the
Secretary of War, in his discretion, to promote enlistments, or for the benefit
of enlisted men.”</p>

</div>

<p>January 8th, Mr. Sumner explained his amendment, remarking as
follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I presume that I do not exaggerate,
if I say, that, of all the questions connected
with this bill, that relating to commutation for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
service is the most difficult and the most sensitive. It
is the question which has most occupied the attention
of the country. It has been most discussed in the newspapers,
and also in conversation. I presume it is the
ground of objection most often made against the draft.</p>

<p>Now I think all Senators will unite in any proposition
that promises in any way to smooth these difficulties,&mdash;in
short, to popularize a part of the bill which
has been open to so much objection among the people.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 12th, in the course of debate, Mr. Sumner replied to Mr.
Sherman, of Ohio.</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Ohio, not contenting himself with
opposing the amendment, introduced other and extraneous
matter, which has been under discussion since,
diverting our minds from the original proposition. But
if I can have his attention for a few minutes, it seems
to me&mdash;I do not know&mdash;- I may even satisfy him that
his argument was not well founded.</p>

<p>If I understand the Senator, he objects to my proposition
on the ground, in the first place, that it is an
unusual tax. Sir, what is the draft but a tax? The
draft compels all persons drafted to contribute strength,
muscle, life, to the defence of the Republic. That, if I
am not mistaken, is the highest tax the country can impose.
But, still further, what is the commutation which
the statute positively requires but a tax? If, then, there
be anything in the argument of the Senator, both the
draft itself and the commutation of three hundred dollars
are a tax, and both are therefore objectionable. But
neither the one nor the other is a tax in a received sense,
because neither the one nor the other is an imposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
for revenue; and I ask the attention of the Senator to
the distinction, neither the one nor the other is an imposition
for revenue. Not on any such ground do I present
this amendment, but simply and distinctly on the
duty of equalizing this burden, that it shall bear, so far
as we can make it, with something like equality upon
the rich and the poor. Now I have to say that at present
the burden is not equalized, and that it does not
bear with anything like equality upon the rich and the
poor. You make the poor man pay three hundred dollars;
but the rich man pays no more. Is this equality?</p>

<p>But the Senator went further. Not satisfied with objecting
to the amendment on the ground that it was a
tax, he complained that it was an exorbitant tax, and
asked me whether in all history I could point to any
instance of a tax of thirty per cent on income. It
seems to me that it should be the pride of our country,
at this moment and on an occasion like this, that it
is not to be deterred by history from an endeavor to
equalize a burden upon the rich and the poor. Because
other nations have not undertaken to equalize this burden,
is that a reason why we should not set the example?
But is the tax exorbitant? I will read it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On all income over six hundred dollars and not over
two thousand dollars, ten per cent; over two thousand dollars
and not over five thousand dollars, twenty per cent;
and on all income over five thousand dollars, thirty per
cent.”<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Now the Senator complains of the thirty per cent,
that is, thirty per cent on an income over five thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
dollars. Suppose a person drafted with an income over
five thousand dollars, I put it to the Senator, what sum
would be too great for him to pay for exemption, carrying
with it, as the draft does, exposure to death, disease,
wounds, with the absolute consumption of time during
the period of one, two, or three years, according to the
duration of the service? Is thirty per cent on an income
above five thousand dollars too much for the exemption?
Is it exorbitant? Is that the estimate the
Senator puts upon such exposure? He requires three
hundred dollars from the poor man who has no income,
but he thinks it exorbitant to require thirty per cent on
an income over five thousand dollars. Sir, I do not
think that even in the requirement of this amendment
there is equality. If any objection can be brought forward,
it is that it is too lenient, that it does not go far
enough.</p>

<p>I am sure, eminent as the Senator is, and justly representing
his own State, that he does not represent on
this question every citizen of that State. I have in my
hand a letter, received since this amendment was first
mentioned, from a most respectable citizen of Cincinnati,
and with your permission I will read three or four sentences
from it. I read simply to show how this proposition
strikes citizens at a distance, yet having the same
interest in it that we have.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Permit a stranger to address a few words to you, expressive
of approbation of your bill”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>He calls it a bill, when it is only an amendment.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">&mdash;“providing for a revision of the Enrolment Act, so as
to afford a sliding scale of commutation for the draft, the
object being to rate commutation according to the means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>of the drafted individual. I quote from telegrams of this
morning’s news. In my humble opinion you have hit the
nail on the head. I think this is the only method to equalize
the burden, and satisfy all claims for justice and equitable
dealing. When any fixed sum is indicated as the commutation
fee to exempt from actual military duty, it needs but
little reflection to see that it indirectly imposes a premium
upon property while it taxes the poor.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then he goes on to suppose a case, somewhat at length,
quite elaborately indeed, between two citizens of Cincinnati,
neighbors, whom he minutely describes, and
finally winds up that part of his communication by
saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Suppose the latter person [whom he calls John Smith]
is drafted. Why, three hundred dollars is no more to him
than a three-penny loaf to the other person. Am I not
right, that a fixed sum for exemption imposes a tax upon
honest poverty and a premium upon wealth?”</p>

</div>

<p>This intelligent constituent of the Senator objects to
his whole theory as a tax upon honest poverty and
a premium upon wealth. The Senator opposes my
amendment as a tax upon wealth. Call it, if you
please, a tax upon wealth. The time has come when
it should be levied. But I put aside such language. I
put aside the idea, except in the general sense, that the
draft itself is a tax, and the amendment simply aims
to equalize that tax.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was lost,&mdash;Yeas 15, Nays 25.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 15th, Mr. Sumner moved his amendment as an additional
section. Again it was lost,&mdash;Yeas 16, Nays 28.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 20th, the Senate having under consideration a bill to prohibit
the discharge of persons from liability to military duty by reason of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>the payment of money, Mr. Sumner moved again the former amendment,
with the further proviso:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the contributions thus made shall be employed by the Secretary
of War as a fund for bounties to be paid to the men actually drafted and
mustered into the service under any call subsequent to the date of this Act,
whenever they shall be honorably discharged, or, in the case of death, to
the widow and minor children of any such man, according to rules and regulations
established by the War Department.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner again vindicated his amendment. In the course of his
remarks, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>When a citizen is drafted as a soldier, and the question
arises of his ransom by a pecuniary contribution,
there is no element of equity which is not shocked,
so my conscience tells me, if you fail to regulate the
requirement of money according to the wealth of the
individual. What is there which a man will not give
for his life? What is there which a man, having the
means, and indisposed to military exposure, will not pay
for his exemption? And yet, Sir, by the law as it now
stands, you compel the poor to pay the same as the rich.
The rich man is drafted, and he pays three hundred
dollars, which to him is nothing; he puts his hand into
his purse, as you put yours into your pocket to find the
change for a newspaper; whereas the poor man, perhaps,
is driven to sell all that he has to save himself for
his family. Sir, is that just? To my mind it is not.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>Suppose the Senator himself were drafted; indisposed,
as he probably would be, to the toils of war, what is
there that he would not consent to pay for exemption?
To him, under such circumstances, the required amount
would be nothing; and yet to the poor man it is everything.
In short, there are many who have it not; and
there are many, who, by calling upon their friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and exhausting every resource within their reach, are
not able to command that small sum; others, perhaps,
just able to command it, are compelled to burden their
families and deny comfort to wife and child.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, the rich man is under no such obligation.
If he be drafted under existing laws, he finds his substitute,
or he tosses into the Treasury the required
amount; he draws his check, and it is all over. Sir,
there is no equity in the law as it stands. The proposition
I present has in it two elements: the first is
that it seeks justice; the second is that it provides a
fund out of which bounties may be distributed by the
Secretary of War among the men drafted and mustered
into service. Here is another attraction to the service,&mdash;or,
if it be not another attraction, it is something
which will mitigate its hardships. The soldier, while
on the field of battle, or on his weary march, will bear
in mind, that, when the time of honorable discharge at
last arrives, or should he be taken away by death, then,
for the benefit of his wife and minor children, he may
look to the fund from these contributions for a bounty
which shall be to him or to them something in the
way of support. Therefore in the pending amendment
is an inducement which all confess is needed to carry
forward our enrolments, and also something more to
mitigate them.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On motion of Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, the bill was recommitted to the
Committee on Military Affairs, who reported it without amendment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 7, 1865, the Senate having under consideration another bill
in addition to the several acts for enrolling and calling out the national
forces and for other purposes, Mr. Sumner seized the occasion to renew
his amendment, and again vindicated it. In reply to Mr. Cowan, of
Pennsylvania, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The Senator from Pennsylvania opposes my proposition,
and treats the Senate to a very elaborate disquisition
on political economy in general, on the depreciation
of the currency in particular, also on taxation, and
still further on salaries.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, admitting all the honorable Senator has so
ably said as perfectly true, that it is according to just
principles of political economy and the experience of
the world (for I am not disposed to go at this moment
into that discussion with the learned Senator), the
proposition that I have the honor to make is not
touched by a hair’s breadth. My proposition involves
no question of political economy, no question of the
currency, or of taxation, or of salaries. It has nothing
to do with any of these matters. Its single and exclusive
object is to equalize the burden of the draft. There
is no political economy in it. There is nothing but justice.
Therefore I propose that every drafted person, before
discharge from the draft, shall be held to contribute
not merely a substitute, but a certain tithe of his annual
gains.</p>

<p>I am not tenacious with regard to the percentage. If
Senators suggest a different rate, I shall be perfectly
willing to yield. The proposition is the best that, under
the circumstances, I can devise. Other Senators
may improve it; it is open to improvement; but I submit
that the criticism of the Senator from Pennsylvania
does not touch it in the least. The proposition still
stands, in its original character, as a measure which, if
adopted, would equalize this burden of the draft. It
would, if I may so express myself, temper this terrible
draft to the poor of the country. It would make them
see that legislators here, while imposing it, thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
the poor, and took such steps as they could to the end
that this burden should not press upon them with undue
severity,&mdash;so that it might, to a certain extent, be
equalized upon them and upon the rich. I know full
well that this cannot be accomplished completely; but,
Sir, an endeavor in such direction is something. I think
that the Senate must make the endeavor. In the name
of the poor, who are liable to be enrolled, I ask it. Let
it appear to the country, that, while requiring this draft,
we recognize inequalities of condition,&mdash;that some are
poor and some rich, and that the same sum ought not
to be exacted from all alike.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The proposition was again lost,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 30. The war was
near its close, and the Senate was not disposed at that late day to enter
upon a change.</p>

<p>In 1850, Hon. John P. Bigelow, Mayor of Boston, declined to receive

suggested that the funds obtained for that purpose be devoted to founding

OATH FOR SENATORS.</h2>

Loyalty for Senators, January 25, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>By an Act of Congress of July 2, 1862, a new oath of office was prescribed
in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That hereafter every person elected or appointed to any office of honor
or profit under the Government of the United States, either in the civil, military,
or naval departments of the public service, excepting the President of
the United States, shall, before entering upon the duties of such office, and
before being entitled to any of the salary or other emoluments thereof, take
and subscribe the following oath or affirmation.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then follows the oath or affirmation, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I, A. B., do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I have never voluntarily
borne arms against the United States since I have been a citizen thereof;
that I have voluntarily given no aid, countenance, counsel, or encouragement
to persons engaged in armed hostility thereto; that I have neither
sought nor accepted nor attempted to exercise the functions of any office
whatever, under any authority or pretended authority in hostility to the
United States; that I have not yielded a voluntary support to any pretended
government, authority, power, or constitution, within the United States,
hostile or inimical thereto. And I do further swear (or affirm) that to the
best of my knowledge and ability I will support and defend the Constitution
of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely,
without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well
and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to
enter. So help me God.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Act then provides:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Which said oath, so taken and signed, shall be preserved among the files
of the Court, House of Congress, or Department to which the said office may
appertain.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This oath was popularly known as “the Iron-Clad Oath.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the organization of the Senate, March 4, 1863, being the first
organization after the statute requiring the oath, it became necessary
to consider its applicability to the Senate. Debate ensued, which can
be understood only by a preliminary explanation.</p>

<p>The Senate was organized, in the absence of the Vice-President, by
the choice of Hon. Solomon Foot, of Vermont, as President <i>pro tempore</i>.
The oath to support the Constitution was administered to him
by Mr. Foster, of Connecticut, but the additional oath was omitted.
The President <i>pro tempore</i> then proceeded to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Senators elect and Senators whose term commences under a reëlection
at this time <i>will receive the oath of office in the order in which their names will
be called by the Secretary</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Secretary then called the names of a long list of Senators, who
came forward and took the customary oath. But the President <i>pro
tempore</i> did not offer to administer the additional oath; nor, at the
time of qualification, was anything said with regard to it. After the
conclusion of the ceremony, Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I desire to call the attention of the President of the Senate, and of the
Senate itself, to an Act of Congress approved 2d July, 1862.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, reading the Act, he added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not know that any motion in regard to it is necessary, further than
calling the attention of the presiding officer and of the Senate to the law.”</p>

</div>

<p>The President <i>pro tempore</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Chair presumes it is sufficient to call the attention of Senators to
that duty, and that that duty will be performed as required by law.”</p>

</div>

<p>Nothing, however, was done by the Chair or by Senators.</p>

<p>The next day, 5th March, two other Senators, Mr. Hendricks and
Mr. Sprague, came forward to be qualified. The Chair proceeded to
administer to these Senators the usual oath to support the Constitution,
but did not administer the additional oath, and these Senators took
their seats. Shortly afterwards, during the session of that day, on a
call of the yeas and nays, all these Senators were called, and answered
to their names.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>Immediately after this call, Mr. Sumner moved an additional rule
of the Senate, requiring that the oath or affirmation prescribed by Act
of Congress of July 2, 1862, should be taken and subscribed by every
Senator in open Senate before entering upon his duties.</p>

<p>On the next day, 6th of March, Mr. Bayard, of Delaware, who had
been absent before, came forward to be qualified. The Chair, as in the
other cases, administered the oath to support the Constitution, but
omitted the additional oath, and Mr. Bayard took his seat. Afterwards,
on this day, Mr. Sumner called up the proposed rule for consideration,
and objected to an executive session until the question of the
rule was settled, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Here is a statute of Congress, and the question is, whether the Senate is
going to set an example of obedience to it or of disobedience; that is all.…
If the Senate now choose to go into executive session, they choose to enter
upon most important duties in disregard of an Act of Congress which they
have assisted in putting upon the statute-book.”</p>

</div>

<p>On coming out of executive session, which was ordered, the Senate
proceeded with the consideration of the proposed rule, when Mr. Sumner
spoke in vindication of it, concluding as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And now, Sir, as I conclude, let me say that I desire to take and subscribe
the new oath in open Senate, that I may in all respects qualify myself
for the discharge of my duties as a Senator. Others will do as they
please, or as the Senate shall require. But I hope that I may appeal to the
Chair to administer that oath to myself, or to direct that it shall be administered.
With the expression of this desire I take my seat.”</p>

</div>

<p>The President <i>pro tempore</i> made no offer to administer the oath, but
said simply:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The subject is under debate.”</p>

</div>

<p>The debate was continued until the Senator from Illinois [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] proposed that the Chair should proceed to administer the
oath, while Mr. Sumner expressed a hope that the Chair would consent
to administer the oath to him.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the President <i>pro tempore</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Chair proposes now to take and subscribe this oath, in pursuance
of the law of 2d July last, and, that being done, the Chair will administer
the oath <i>to such members as will voluntarily take it</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The oath was then administered to Mr. Foot by Mr. Foster. Resuming
the chair, the President <i>pro tempore</i> then said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Chair will now direct the Clerk to call, in alphabetical order, the
names of all Senators who have been elected or reëlected since the 2d July,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>1862, that being the day of the approval of the Act; and <i>such Senators present</i>,
whose names shall be called, <i>as choose to do so</i>, will come forward to the
Secretary’s desk and receive the oath of office administered by the Chair,
<i>after which they will have an opportunity to subscribe the oath</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Senators present, whose names were called, some of them after
delay, came forward and took the oath; and then, at the suggestion of
the Chair, Mr. Sumner withdrew the resolution. The Senator from
Delaware [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayard</span>] was not then present.</p>

<p>Before withdrawing the resolution, Mr. Sumner, in reply to Mr.
Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, again vindicated the proposed rule,
insisting that the statute was applicable to Senators as “civil officers,”
concluding as follows.</p>

</div>

<p>It is our duty to guard the loyalty of this Chamber.
In requiring that a person shall purge himself with
regard to the past, we simply take a new assurance of
fidelity for the present. Others may think that Jefferson
Davis, Robert Toombs, or Judah Benjamin may
resume his seat in this body, on taking a simple oath
to support the Constitution. I do not think so; and I
gladly seize the earliest opportunity, since the commentary
of the Senator from Maryland, to declare my conviction
that no person, whose loyalty is not manifest to
the Senate, can be allowed to approach your desk and
take the oath of a Senator. The Senate must shut the
door upon him. This is not the first time that I have
made this declaration: nor have I contented myself
with making the declaration; I have argued it. Nothing
is clearer than this: a traitor cannot be a member
of the Senate. But a person who cannot take this oath,
retroactive though it be, must have been a traitor. Once
a traitor, always a traitor, unless where changed by pardon
or amnesty.</p>

<p>I know not what changes may be required by changing
events. For myself, I shall always welcome every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
act of just clemency or condonation. But for the present
the statute is wise and conservative. It only remains
that we should stand by it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>At the next session of Congress Mr. Sumner returned to this question.
December 17, 1863, he submitted a resolution proposing a new
rule.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the following be added to the rules of the Senate:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The oath or affirmation prescribed by Act of Congress of July 2, 1862,
to be taken and subscribed before entering upon the duties of office, shall
be taken and subscribed by every Senator in open Senate before entering
upon his duties. It shall also be taken and subscribed in the same way by
the Secretary of the Senate; but the other officers of the Senate may take
and subscribe it in the office of the Secretary.”</p>

</div>

<p>December 18th, the resolution came up for consideration, when Mr.
Saulsbury, of Delaware, moved as a substitute that the Judiciary Committee
be directed to inquire whether Senators and Representatives are
included within the provisions of the Act prescribing the oath, and
whether the Act is constitutional. Subsequently, he moved that the
whole subject, including the resolution and the substitute, be referred
to the Judiciary Committee, which, after debate, was rejected,&mdash;Yeas
15, Nays 26. The debate was continued, in the course of which Mr.
Bayard, of Delaware, Mr. Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, and Mr.
Collamer, of Vermont, spoke at length.</p>

<p>January 25, 1864, Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There is a time for all things;
but there are times when certain things are out
of place; and this principle is especially applicable to
the present debate. The question is on the adoption of
a rule of the Senate to carry out an existing statute. It
is not on the passage of the statute, or on its proposed
repeal, but it is simply on its recognition as an existing
statute, and the enforcement of its plain requirement.
Considering the simplicity of the question, well may we
be astonished at much that has been intruded into this
debate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>The Senate is a branch of the legislative power, in
conjunction with the House of Representatives and the
President. Neither alone can make or unmake a law.
The concurrence of all three is essential, whether in
making or unmaking. So long as the law exists, there
is no difference between the obligations of the Senate
and the obligations of the humblest citizen, except, perhaps,
that the Senate, which helped to make the law,
is bound to set an example of obedience beyond any
citizen.</p>

<p>Therefore I put aside, as entirely irrelevant, much that
we have heard against the proposed rule. This is not the
time to say that the oath is unconstitutional, or that it is
<i>ex post facto</i>. These are considerations properly arising
on the passage of the statute, or on a proposition for its
repeal. The Senator from Delaware [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayard</span>] and
the Senator from Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>], who have
argued these topics so exhaustively, were either too late
or too early. The statute is already the law of the land,
and there is no bill pending for its repeal.</p>

<p>On a former occasion I vindicated the constitutionality
of the statute, and I now willingly leave that topic
to the judgment of Senators, enlightened by the wisdom
of the Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>], whose
argument has not been answered. But I repeat that
this objection is utterly out of place at this moment.</p>

<p>A Senator over the way [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hendricks</span>] has gone
so far as to introduce my course on a former occasion
as an apology for not taking the oath.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> Because I denounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
an infamous statute, which was a scandal to
civilization, as unconstitutional and utterly unworthy
the support of virtuous citizens, it is argued that the
Slave-Drivers, then in power, were more lenient to me
than we are now to them. In other words, the Slave-Drivers
required of me an oath to support a statute which
I abhorred, and therefore we are wrong in requiring the
proposed oath. But this argument confounds two cases
which are wide apart as the poles. While denouncing
an outrageous statute, and refusing to play the part of
slave-hunter, I never joined in rebellion against my
country, or uttered one word except in loyalty. But
here are persons with bloody hands, in battle array,
striking at all we hold dear,&mdash;or others who have acted
with them. Such persons will be justly brought to
the test of an oath, and they can claim no immunity
from the example of those patriot citizens who, recognizing
the crime of Slavery, refused to become in any
way its tools.</p>

<p>And another Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>] has taken this
occasion to arraign me for certain opinions on another
question, and he complained that I place them under
the protection of a judgment of the Supreme Court.
This is not the time for the discussion of “Reconstruction.”
It has nothing to do with the matter before the
Senate. I may think that the Government of the United
States has <i>belligerent rights</i>, as well as <i>the right of sovereignty</i>,
over the Rebel States,&mdash;that it is especially the
duty of Congress to take care that these rights are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
exercised as to crush the Rebellion, and to prevent its
breaking out again,&mdash;and that, to this end, Congress
must take all possible bonds for the future. These
opinions, which the Senator chose to characterize harshly,
may be wrong, but they have nothing to do with the
business in hand. At a proper time I shall be ready
to defend them. At present I choose not to be diverted
from the issue before us.</p>

<p>Putting aside irrelevant questions, and presenting the
single point in issue, the case becomes too plain for argument.
It is simply this: Will the Senate obey an
existing statute? But here we must consider the meaning
of the statute.</p>

<p>That the Senate will openly refuse obedience to an
existing statute, recently enacted, in support of loyalty,
is not to be supposed without impeachment of the
loyalty of the Senate. Only because the question of
obedience has been complicated with other questions
has there been for a moment any doubt on this head.
Clearly, the Senate will not disobey an existing statute.
It is, then, on the statute alone, and nothing else, that
any question can arise.</p>

<p>And here I ask leave to recall the Senate from the
learned commentary and elaborate diversion of the Senator
from Delaware. The actual question is one which
may be treated without learning and without effort. It
arises on the following words of the statute:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Hereafter every person <i>elected</i> or appointed to any <i>office</i>
of honor or profit under the Government of the United
States, <i>either in the civil</i>, <i>military</i>, <i>or naval departments of
the public service</i>, excepting the President of the United
States, shall, before entering upon the duties of <i>such office</i>,
and before being entitled to any of the salary or other emoluments
thereof, take and subscribe the following oath or
affirmation [<i>here follows the oath</i>]; which said oath, so taken
and signed, shall be preserved among the files of the Court,
<i>House of Congress</i>, or Department to which the said office
may appertain.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It cannot fail to be observed here that the language
is plain rather than technical. Every person “elected”
or “appointed” to any “office” in the “<i>civil</i>, military,
or naval departments of the public service” must take
the oath. What words could be broader than “departments”
and “public service”?</p>

<p>Obviously, and beyond all question, a Senator is
“elected.” Therefore on this point there is no question.</p>

<p>The inquiry recurs, Is a Senator an “officer” in the
“civil department of the public service”?</p>

<p>Is he an “officer”?</p>

<p>Is he in the “civil department”?</p>

<p>To raise these questions seems absurd. But I have
not raised them. This is done by others. You might
as well raise the question, if a man is a creature, and
belongs to the human family.</p>

<p>Look now at these questions in their order.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. Is a Senator an “officer”? Here please to consult
the dictionary. I turn to Webster.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Office.</span>&mdash;<i>Offices</i> are civil, judicial, ministerial, executive,
<i>legislative</i>, political, municipal, diplomatic, military, ecclesiastical,
&amp;c.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thus, plainly, offices are <i>legislative</i>. But why summon
the dictionary? And yet the zeal of the other side leaves
no alternative.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Not content with the dictionary, I call attention to
the use of the word in other authoritative places,&mdash;and
pardon me, if I begin with the Constitution of Massachusetts,
written originally by John Adams.</p>

<p>In the Bill of Rights of this Constitution it is declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All power residing originally in the people, and being
derived from them, the several magistrates and <i>officers</i> of
government, vested with authority, whether <i>legislative</i>, executive,
or judicial, are their substitutes and agents, and
are at all times accountable to them.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Members of the <i>Legislature</i> are classed among <i>officers</i>,
and thus this word received its interpretation.</p>

<p>In another part of the same Constitution it is provided:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Any person chosen Governor, Lieutenant-Governor, Councillor,
<i>Senator</i>, or <i>Representative</i>, and accepting the <i>trust</i>, shall,
before he proceed to execute the duties of his <i>place</i> or <i>office</i>,
make and subscribe the following declaration.”<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the <i>place</i> or <i>trust</i> of a <i>Senator</i> or <i>Representative</i>
is called an <i>office</i>. And this same use of these terms, as
synonymous, and applicable to the post of <i>Senator</i> or
<i>Representative</i>, is continued:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Every person chosen to either of the places or <i>offices</i>
aforesaid [meaning the <i>offices</i> of Governor, Lieutenant-Governor,
Councillor, <i>Senator</i>, or <i>Representative</i>] … shall, before
he enters on the discharge of the business of his place
or <i>office</i>, take and subscribe,”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>The authority of New Hampshire is like that of Massachusetts.
Her Constitution declares:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All power residing originally in, and being derived from,
the people, all the magistrates and <i>officers</i> of government are
their substitutes and agents, and at all times accountable to
them.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the word “officers” obviously means the <i>substitutes</i>
and <i>agents</i> of the people. But who are substitutes
and agents of the people more than <i>Senators</i>?</p>

<p>Then again, in the same Constitution, it is declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No <i>office</i> or place whatsoever in government shall be hereditary.”<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the word “office” is made synonymous with
“place.”</p>

<p>The Constitution of Vermont testifies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All power being originally inherent in, and consequently
derived from, the people, therefore all <i>officers</i> of government,
whether <i>legislative</i> or executive, are their trustees and servants.”<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, in Vermont, members of the Legislature are
“officers.”</p>

<p>The old Constitution of New Jersey testifies also, in
the clause prescribing the qualifications entitling a person
to vote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For representatives in Council and Assembly, and also
for all <i>other</i> public <i>officers</i> that shall be elected by the people
of the county at large.”<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here again members of the <i>Legislature</i> are treated as
“public <i>officers</i>.”</p>

<p>The Constitution of Pennsylvania testifies:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Members of the General Assembly, and <i>all officers</i>, executive
and judicial, shall be bound by oath or affirmation to
support the Constitution of this Commonwealth, and to perform
the duties of their respective <i>offices</i> with fidelity.”<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here members of the General Assembly are classed
with those holding “offices.”</p>

<p>The original Constitution of New York is more positive:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The chancellor and judges of the Supreme Court shall
not at the same time hold <i>any other office</i>, excepting that of
Delegate to the General Congress upon special occasions;
and the first judges of the county courts in the several
counties shall not at the same time hold any other <i>office</i>,
excepting that of <i>Senator</i> or Delegate to the General Congress.”<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the post of Delegate to the General Congress,
and also of “Senator,” is treated as an “office.”</p>

<p>Surely this is enough. The post of Senator is an office
of honor or profit, and a “Senator” is an “officer.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>2. But, assuming that the post of Senator is an “office,”
and that a Senator is an “officer,” the question
occurs, To what “department of the public service” does
he belong?</p>

<p>Clearly he is not of the “military” or “naval” department.
But if not “military” or “naval,” he must
be “civil.” Here again consult the dictionary. I cite
Webster.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Civil.</i> It is distinguished from <i>ecclesiastical</i>, which respects
the Church, and from <i>military</i>, which respects the
army and navy.&mdash;This term is often employed in contrast
with <i>military</i>: as, a <i>civil</i> hospital, the <i>civil</i> service, &amp;c.”</p>

<p>“<i>Civil List.</i> In England, formerly, a list of the entire
expenses of the <i>civil</i> government; hence the officers of <i>civil</i>
government, who are paid from the public treasury; also,
the revenue appropriated to support the <i>civil</i> government.”</p>

<p>“<i>Civil State.</i> The whole body of the laity or citizens,
not included under the military, maritime, and ecclesiastical
states.”</p>

</div>

<p>To say that a Senator is not included under this
comprehensive, but distinctive term, is simply an absurdity.</p>

<p>It is evident that Congress adopted the words of the
statute because they were comprehensive and distinctive.
They obviously comprehended all “officers” in the
“public service,” whether “elected,” like a Senator, or
“appointed,” like a judge. But, beyond their plainness,
these words had this added advantage, that already for
more than a generation they had received a practical
interpretation from Congress.</p>

<p>Here is the familiar Blue Book. Its title-page begins:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Register of <i>officers and agents</i>, <i>civil</i>, military, and naval,
<i>in the service of the United States</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Turning to the contents, we find in this list Members
of Congress, including Senators and Representatives,
with the “officers and agents” of the two Houses.</p>

<p>If we go back to the Blue Book for 1820, which is
now in my hands, we find the same title, and the same
enumeration of Senators and Representatives.</p>

<p>This Blue Book is still published, in pursuance of a
joint resolution by Congress, originally adopted as long
ago as 27th April, 1816, with the following title:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Resolution requiring the Secretary of State to compile
and print, once in every two years, <i>a register of all officers
and agents</i>, <i>civil</i>, military, and naval, in the service of the
United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>If Senators are properly included in such a register,
it is only as belonging to the “<i>civil</i> department of the
public service,” which is precisely where they have been
placed by the recent Act of Congress.</p>

<p>The only apology for the objection urged from the
beginning of this debate with so much pertinacity is
founded on the case of Mr. Blount, the Senator expelled
and afterwards impeached, at the close of the last century.
I shall not take time to consider this case. It
has been amply done by others. On former occasions I
have done it at length. And yet I will not leave it
without protesting again that it is absolutely inapplicable
to the present occasion. If that case were out of the
way, nobody would have suggested that a “Senator” was
not an “<i>officer</i> in the <i>civil</i> department of the public service.”
Now what did this case decide? Let another
give the summary. I quote the words of Mr. Wharton,
in the notes to his edition of the State Trials.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>In a legal point of view</i>, all that this case decides is, that
a Senator of the United States, who has been expelled from
his seat, is not, after such expulsion, subject to impeachment;
and <i>perhaps</i> from this the broader proposition may
be drawn, that none are liable to impeachment except officers
of the government, in the technical sense, excluding
thereby members of the National Legislature.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The case of Mr. Blount has no application to the
present question. It is not an interpretation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
statute, and so far as it illustrates the Constitution it
simply concerns the liability to impeachment. But
even this case has often been drawn into doubt. And
if we look into the proceedings of the time, we find that
the decision, such as it was, encountered an able and
earnest opposition.</p>

<p>Among those who took a distinguished part on
that occasion was James A. Bayard,<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> of Delaware, the
eminent Representative who conducted the impeachment
as Manager on the part of the House of Representatives.
In his effective argument he has set forth the
true signification of the Constitution. From the argument
of the Senator from Delaware [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayard</span>] in
the present debate I confidently appeal to that of the
earlier Mr. Bayard. Here is a passage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have submitted, in the course of my argument, that
the sound principle of construction to be adopted, in relation
to the construction of an instrument having in view the vast
object of settling the powers of the Government and the
rights of the people, is to give it such an interpretation as
is best calculated to give effect generally to all its parts according
to its true design. If I am supported in this principle,
I shall be able to show, by strong cases under the
Constitution, that its undeniable intention must be frustrated,
if a Senator be not considered an officer of the United States.</p>

<p>“I find it provided in the seventh clause of the third section
of the first article, that conviction on impeachment disqualifies
the party convicted from holding any <i>office</i> of honor,
trust, or profit under the United States. If a seat in the
Senate be not an office, the disqualification does not extend
to it. And yet can it reasonably be contended that the policy
which incapacitates a citizen, if convicted on impeachment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>from holding an office the most mean and humble,
does not apply to the case of a Senator? The wisdom of
the Constitution, Sir, has considered a conviction as an evidence
of moral unfitness for public trust. It never can happen
but in the case of a great national offence. And shall
such an offender, degraded from the capacity of even being
doorkeeper of this Chamber, yet retain the capacity of being
a member of a body of the most dignity, trust, and power in
the country? This is a solecism in politics, an absurdity in
reason, which I trust this honorable court will not willingly
by their act attach to an instrument so highly and justly
revered as the Constitution of our Government.</p>

<p>“I find also a provision in the seventh [eighth] clause of
the ninth section of the first article, that ‘no person holding
any office of profit or trust under the United States shall,
without the consent of the Congress, accept of any present,
emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any
king, prince, or foreign state.’ If a Senator holds no office of
profit or trust under the United States, it is <i>lawful</i> for him to
accept a present, title, or office from any king or foreign state.
Can it be possible that a public functionary, of all others the
peculiar object of this jealous restriction, is, in fact, the sole
object of exemption from its operation? Can it be imagined
that a Senator, upon whom the Constitution has heaped the
powers and trusts of legislator, judge, and executive magistrate,
is the only person who is left exposed to the seductions
of foreign influence? It can never be admitted that a
situation which from its trust and importance most invites
corruption is the only one which the Constitution has not
guarded against. If, Sir, a Senator be not an officer under
this clause, it might happen that the Senate of the United
States might become a House of Lords. It would be in the
power of any king in Europe to change our free government,
and to convert one branch, at least, from a republican into
an aristocratic form. You will not suffer an ensign in your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>army to accept the humble title of Chevalier, and yet you
will allow an integral part of the Government to be composed
of earls and dukes. And let me pray the honorable Court to
remember, at the same time, that the Constitution has provided
that a member of either House shall not be allowed
to retain his seat and hold any commission, civil or military,
under the United States. The President has no titles to
grant, nor offices of great emolument to confer; and yet
the chaste republicanism of the Constitution will not allow
a Senator to feel the influence of his patronage; and yet, at
the same time, he may <i>lawfully</i> be the pensioner or the titular
noble of a foreign power. Such a doctrine is not simply
absurd, but infinitely dangerous.”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In view of these emphatic words, it is difficult to see
how any person can insist that a “Senator” is not a
“civil officer,” even according to the text of the Constitution.
Conceding to the judgment on the trial of impeachment
all the authority which can belong to it, you
cannot properly deduce from it any conclusion, except
that a Senator already expelled is not a “civil officer”
liable to impeachment: nothing beyond this.</p>

<p>But whatever the signification of this word in the
Constitution, even conceding all that is claimed for it
there, the instance is entirely inapplicable to the interpretation
of the statute in question. If there be doubt
on the Constitution, there is none on the statute. The
latter is plain, and there are no associate words to interfere
with its natural and unequivocal signification.</p>

<p>I conclude this branch of the subject as I began, by
putting aside all irrelevant matter, all superfluous questions,
all surplusage, all topics not properly germane to
the debate. There is no question of the Constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
no question of <i>ex post facto</i>, but a simple question on the
meaning of a statute.</p>

<p>The oath is prescribed by Congress. It is too late to
debate its constitutionality thus incidentally. It only
remains for us to take it, promptly, patriotically. The
procrastination of this debate is of evil example. How
can we expect the alacrity of loyalty among the people,
if the Senate hesitates?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another objection to the proposed rule has been
brought forward by the Senator from Vermont [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Foot</span>]. According to him, the statute is obligatory,
and the oath must be taken by Senators, but a rule requiring
the oath is superfluous and without precedent.
The argument of the Senator is plausible, but it is
answered by a simple statement of facts, in which, as
presiding officer of the Senate, he bore a conspicuous
part.</p>

<p>From this statement it will appear that the rule, or
some equivalent action of the Senate, is not superfluous.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner set forth the facts substantially as presented in
the Introduction, showing the necessity of the proposed rule, and then
proceeded.</p>

</div>

<p>The language of the Chair, when inviting Senators to
take the oath, left a loophole through which they might
avoid the oath. It was, “Such Senators present <i>as choose
to do so</i> will come forward,” and then “they will have
<i>an opportunity to subscribe the oath</i>.” In such terms
Senators were invited to do as they pleased, thus making
a discrimination between the earlier oath, which
they were obliged to take in order to be qualified, and
the additional oath, which they were free to neglect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Such is a plain statement of facts, which I make in
no spirit of personal criticism, but simply that you may
see the occasion for the proposed rule.</p>

<p>Had the Chair at the beginning proceeded to administer
the additional oath, as the earlier oath, there would
have been no occasion for a rule. Or had the Chair
afterwards, when attention was called to the omission,
administered the additional oath according to the requirement
of the statute, there would have been no
occasion for a rule.</p>

<p>The Chair did no such thing, but left the taking of
the oath to the conscience or will of each Senator.
And though the statute solemnly declares that “every
person <i>elected</i> or appointed to any office of honor or
profit under the Government of the United States …
shall, <i>before entering upon the duties of such office, and before
being entitled to any of the salary or other emoluments
thereof</i>, take and subscribe” the oath in question, yet
the Senator from Delaware [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bayard</span>] has not only
“entered upon the duties” of his office as Senator, but
he has continued to discharge these duties, and to draw
his salary, although he has never taken and subscribed
the oath.</p>

<p>Evidently something must be done to correct this incongruity,
and to rehabilitate, if I may so say, the Act
of Congress. I know no better way than by the proposed
rule. But I have no partiality for this mode. I am
ready for any other proposition which will lift the statute
from the desuetude and neglect into which it was
allowed to fall, and will secure its enforcement. In the
events at hand this statute will be a safeguard of the
Republic, and its enforcement here will secure its enforcement
everywhere. To the traitor seeking office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
it will be a touchstone, while, with guardian force, it
thrusts away from these Chambers all those brutal enemies,
who, for the sake of Slavery, have helped to fill
our land with mourning.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On the Yeas and Nays, the vote stood, Yeas 28, Nays 11. So the
resolution was adopted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 26th Mr. Bayard took the prescribed oath, and on the 29th
resigned his seat in the Senate.</p>

<p>January 25th, Mr. Sumner asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to bring in a bill supplementary to an Act entitled “An
Act to prescribe an oath of office and for other purposes,” approved July
2, 1862, which was read the first and second times by unanimous consent,
and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. It provided that
no person should be admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court of the
United States, or of any Circuit or District Court of the United States,
or of the Court of Claims, as an attorney or counsellor of such court, or
should be allowed to appear and be heard in any such court, by virtue
of any previous admission or any special power of attorney, unless he
should have first taken the oath prescribed by the Act of July 2, 1862.</p>

<p>June 28th, Mr. Trumbull, from the Judiciary Committee, reported
adversely on this bill.</p>

<p>December 22d, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the Senate proceeded to
consider this bill, and it was passed,&mdash;Yeas 27, Nays 4. January 23,
1865, it passed the House of Representatives, and January 24th was
approved by the President.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LATE_HON_JOHN_W_NOELL_REPRESENTATIVE" id="THE_LATE_HON_JOHN_W_NOELL_REPRESENTATIVE"></a>THE LATE HON. JOHN W. NOELL, REPRESENTATIVE
OF MISSOURI.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on his Death, February 1, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The personal acquaintance
which I had with Mr. Noell was very slight;
but I honored him much, as a public servant who at
a critical moment discerned clearly the path of duty
and had the courage to tread it.</p>

<p>Born among slaves and living always under the shadow
of Slavery, his character was not corrupted, nor was
his judgment obscured. All of us, although born among
freemen, and living far away from that influence so unhappily
disturbing our country, might take counsel from
his intelligent alacrity. While others hesitated, he was
prompt. While others surrendered to procrastination,
he grappled at once with the giant evil. Such a man
was exceptional, and now that he is dead he deserves
exceptional honors.</p>

<p>There are men in history who by a single effort fix
public attention. A member of Parliament in the last
century was known as “Single-Speech Hamilton.” Others
have become famous from the support of a single
measure. Perhaps Mr. Noell may find place in this
class. But no “Single-Speech Hamilton” could claim
the homage which belongs to him.</p>

<p>There have been many in Congress from the Slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
States, but he was the first in our history inspired to
bring in a bill for the abolition of Slavery in a State. Rejecting
the palpable sophistries by which it was sought
to postpone an act of unquestionable justice, and discarding
the idea that wrong was to be dealt with tardily,
gradually, or prospectively, he proposed Immediate
Emancipation. Let it be spoken in his praise. Let it
be carved on his tombstone. His bill passed the House.
It was lost in the Senate.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> But it was not lost to his
fame. He died without beholding the fulfilment of his
desires, but the cause with which his name is associated
cannot die.</p>

<p>Among the human benefactors of Missouri, so rich in
natural resources, he must always be numbered; and
his memory will be appreciated there just in proportion
as men discern what contributes most to the wealth, the
character, and the true nobility of a State. Hereafter,
when the present conflict is ended and peace once
more blesses our wide-spread land, he will be mentioned
gratefully with those who saw truly how this blessing
was to be secured, and bravely strove for it. Better in
that day to have been a doorkeeper in the house of
Freedom than a dweller in the tents of the ungodly:
and what ungodliness can compare with the ungodliness
of Slavery, whether in the lash of the taskmaster or in
the speech of its apologist?</p>

AGAINST SLAVERY AND FOR PROTECTION OF FREEDMEN.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolutions in the Senate, February 8, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the Senate, February 8, 1864, the following resolutions, submitted
by Mr. Sumner, were read and ordered to be printed.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Resolutions defining the character of the national contest,
and protesting against any premature restoration of Rebel
States, without proper guaranties and safeguards against
Slavery and for the protection of Freedmen.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">RESOLVED, That, in determining the duties of the
National Government, it is of first importance that
we should see and understand the real character of the
contest forced upon the United States, for failure to
appreciate this contest must end in failure of those
proper efforts essential to the reëstablishment of unity
and concord; that, recognizing the contest in its real
character, as it must be recorded by history, it is apparent
that it is not an ordinary rebellion or an ordinary
war, but that it is absolutely without precedent, differing
from every other rebellion and every other war, inasmuch
as it is an audacious attempt, for the first time
in history, to found a wicked power on the corner-stone
of Slavery; and that such an attempt, having this single
object,&mdash;whether regarded as rebellion or war,&mdash;is
so completely penetrated and absorbed, so entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
filled and possessed by Slavery, that it can be regarded
as nothing else than the huge impersonation of this
crime, at once rebel and belligerent, or, in other words,
as <i>Slavery in arms</i>.</p>

<p>2. That, recognizing the identity of the Rebellion and
Slavery, so that each is to the other as another self, it
becomes plain that the Rebellion cannot be crushed
without crushing Slavery, as Slavery cannot be crushed
without crushing the Rebellion; that every forbearance
to the one is forbearance to the other, and every blow at
the one is a blow at the other; that all who tolerate
Slavery tolerate the Rebellion, and all who strike at
Slavery strike at the Rebellion; and that, therefore, it
is our supreme duty, in which all other present duties
are contained, to take care that the barbarism of Slavery,
in which alone the Rebellion has its origin and life,
is so utterly trampled out that it can never spring up
again anywhere in the Rebel and belligerent region; for,
leaving this duty undone, nothing is done, and all our
blood and treasure are lavished in vain.</p>

<p>3. That, in dealing with the Rebel War, the National
Government is invested with two classes of rights,&mdash;one
the <i>Rights of Sovereignty</i>, inherent and indefeasible
everywhere within the national limits, and the other
the <i>Rights of War</i>, or belligerent rights, superinduced
by the nature and extent of the contest; that, by virtue
of the Rights of Sovereignty, the Rebel and belligerent
region is now subject to the nation as its only rightful
government, bound under the Constitution to all the
duties of sovereignty, and by special mandate bound
also to guaranty to every State a republican form of
government, and to protect it against invasion; that,
by virtue of the Rights of War, this same region is subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
to all the conditions and incidents of war, according
to the established usages of Christian nations, out of
which is derived the familiar maxim of public duty,
“Indemnity for the past and security for the future.”</p>

<p>4. That, in seeking restoration of the States to their
proper places as members of the Republic, so that every
State shall enjoy again its constitutional functions,
and every star on the national flag shall represent a
State in reality as well as in name, care must be taken
that the Rebellion is not allowed, through any negligence
or mistaken concession, to retain the least foothold
for future activity, or the least germ of future life;
that, whether proceeding by the exercise of sovereign
rights or of belligerent rights, the same precautions
must be exacted against future peril; that, therefore,
any system of “Reconstruction” must be rejected which
does not provide by irreversible guaranties against the
continued existence or possible revival of Slavery, and
that such guaranties can be primarily obtained only
through the agency of the National Government, which
to this end must assert a temporary supremacy, military
or civil, throughout the Rebel and belligerent region, of
sufficient duration to stamp upon this region the character
of Freedom.</p>

<p>5. That, in the exercise of this essential supremacy
of the nation, a solemn duty is cast upon Congress to
see that no Rebel State is prematurely restored to its
constitutional functions until within its borders all
proper safeguards are established, so that loyal citizens,
including the new-made freedmen, cannot at any time
be molested by evil-disposed persons, and especially
that no man there may be made a slave; that this solemn
duty belongs to Congress under the Constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
whether in the exercise of Rights of Sovereignty or
Rights of War, and that in its performance that system
of “Reconstruction” will be best, howsoever named,
which promises most surely to accomplish the desired
end, so that Slavery, which is the synonym of the Rebellion,
shall absolutely cease throughout the whole
Rebel and belligerent region, and the land it has maddened,
impoverished, and degraded shall become safe,
fertile, and glorious from assured Emancipation.</p>

<p>6. That, in the process of “Reconstruction,” it is not
enough to secure the death of Slavery throughout the
Rebel and belligerent region only; that experience testifies
against Slavery wherever it exists, not only as
crime against humanity, but as disturber of the public
peace and spoiler of the public liberties, including liberty
of the press, liberty of speech, and liberty of travel
and transit; that, in the progress of civilization, it has
become incompatible with good government, and especially
with that “republican form of government” which
the United States are bound to guaranty to every State;
that from the outbreak of this Rebel war, even in States
professing loyalty, it has been an open check upon patriotic
duty and an open accessory to the Rebellion, so
as to be a source of unquestionable weakness to the
national cause; that the defiant pretensions of the master
claiming control of his slave are in direct conflict
with paramount rights of the nation; and that, therefore,
it is the further duty of Congress, in the exercise
of its double powers under the Constitution, as guardian
of the national safety, to take all needful steps for the
extinction of Slavery, even in States professing loyalty,
so that this crime against humanity, this disturber of
the public peace, and this spoiler of the public liberties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
shall no longer exist anywhere to menace the general
harmony, that civilization may be no longer shocked,
that the constitutional guaranty of a republican form
of government to every State may be fulfilled, that the
Rebellion may be deprived of the traitorous aid and
comfort Slavery has instinctively volunteered, and that
the master claiming an unnatural property in human
flesh may no longer defy the nation.</p>

<p>7. That, in addition to the guaranties stipulated by
Congress, and as the cap-stone to its work of restoration
and reconciliation, the Constitution itself must be so
amended as to prohibit Slavery everywhere within the
limits of the Republic; that such prohibition, leaving
all personal claims, whether of slave or master, to the
legislation of Congress and of the States, will be a sacred
and inviolable guaranty, representing the collective
will of the people of the United States, and placing
Universal Emancipation under sanction of the Constitution,
so that Freedom shall be engraved on every foot
of the national soil and be woven into every star of the
national flag, while it elevates and inspires our whole
national existence, and the Constitution, so often invoked
for Slavery, but at last in harmony with the Declaration
of Independence, will become, according to the aspirations
of its founders, sublime guardian of the inalienable
right of every human being to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness: all of which must be done in the
name of the Union, in duty to humanity, and for the
sake of permanent peace.</p>

<p>These several petitions are consolidated into one, being
another illustration of the motto on our coin,&mdash;<i>E
pluribus unum</i>.</p>

<p>This unprecedented petition is signed by one hundred
thousand men and women, who unite in this unparalleled
number to support its prayer. They are from all
parts of the country, and from every condition of life:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
from the seaboard, fanned by the free airs of the ocean,
and from the Mississippi and the prairies of the West,
fanned by the free airs which vitalize that extensive region;
from the families of the educated and uneducated,
rich and poor, of every profession, business, and calling
in life, representing every sentiment, thought, hope, passion,
activity, intelligence, that inspires, strengthens, and
adorns our social system. Here they are, a mighty army,
one hundred thousand strong, without arms or banners,
the advance-guard of a yet larger army.</p>

<p>Though memorable for numbers, these petitioners are
more memorable for the prayer in which they unite.
They ask nothing less than Universal Emancipation;
and this they ask directly at the hands of Congress.
No reason is assigned. The prayer speaks. It is simple,
positive. So far as it proceeds from the women of
the country, it is naturally a petition and not an argument.
But I need not remind the Senate that there is
no reason so strong as the reason of the heart. Do not
all great thoughts come from the heart?</p>

<p>It is not for me at this moment to offer reasons which
the one hundred thousand petitioners have forborne.
But I may properly add, that, naturally and obviously,
they all feel in their hearts, what reason and knowledge
confirm, not only that Slavery <i>as a Unit</i>, one and indivisible,
is the guilty origin of the Rebellion, but that its
influence everywhere, even outside the Rebel States, is
hostile to the Union, always impairing loyalty, and
sometimes openly menacing the national cause. It requires
no difficult logic to conclude that such a monster,
wherever it shows its head, is a <i>National Enemy</i>, to be
pursued and destroyed as such, or at least a nuisance to
the national cause, to be abated as such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

<p>The petitioners know well that Congress is the depository
of those supreme powers by which rebellion,
alike in its root and distant offshoots, may be surely
crushed, while unity and peace are permanently assured.
They know well that the action of Congress
may be with the coöperation of the Slave-Masters, or
even without their coöperation, under the overruling
law of military necessity, or the commanding precept
of the Constitution to guaranty a republican form of
government. Above all, they know well that to save
the country from peril, especially to save the national
life, there is no power in the ample arsenal of self-defence
which Congress may not grasp; for to Congress,
under the Constitution, belongs the prerogative
of the Roman Dictator, to see that the Republic receives
no detriment. Therefore to Congress these petitioners
appeal.</p>

<p>I ask the reference of the petition to the Select Committee
on Slavery and Freedmen.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>An earnest debate ensued, which ended in the reference of the petition.</p>

<h2><a name="EQUAL_PAY_OF_COLORED_SOLDIERS" id="EQUAL_PAY_OF_COLORED_SOLDIERS"></a>EQUAL PAY OF COLORED SOLDIERS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on different Propositions, February
10, 29, and June 11, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 3d, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, reported a joint resolution
to equalize the pay of soldiers in the United States army, which
provided that all persons of color, who have been or may be mustered
into the military service of the United States, shall receive the same
uniform, clothing, arms, equipments, camp equipage, rations, medical
and hospital attendance, pay and emoluments, other than bounty, as
other soldiers of the regular or volunteer forces of the United States of
like arm of service, during the whole term in which they shall be or shall
have been in such service, and every person of color who shall hereafter
be mustered into the service shall receive such sums in bounty as the
President shall order in the different States and parts of the United
States, not exceeding one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>February 4th, the Senate considered the joint resolution. Mr. Fessenden,
of Maine, “wished to inquire what propriety there is in our
going back and paying them this increase for services already rendered.”
Mr. Wilson thought, “as an act of justice, the bill should
be retrospective,”&mdash;that “the gross injustice done by the country toward
these men ought to be corrected.” Mr. Fessenden was in favor,
and had ever been in favor, of putting colored soldiers on a level with
white, but he was opposed to paying men for services already rendered,
unless the men were promised full pay by orders emanating from the
War Department. Mr. Sumner, after stating that there were two
classes of enlistments, first, under the statute of 1861, and, secondly,
under the statute of 1862, insisted that under the former statute any
person of African descent might be enlisted and entitled to the same
pay as a white soldier. “There was no limitation in the statute. There
was no color there. There was nothing against the enlistment of colored
men under that statute, except a blind prejudice which we ought
to forget.” He concluded:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span> “I wish to see our colored troops treated
like white troops in every respect. But I would not press this first
principle by any retroactive proposition, unless where the faith of the
Government is committed, and there I would not hesitate. The Treasury
can bear any additional burden better than the country can bear
to do an injustice.”</p>

<p>February 10th, the subject being still under consideration, Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am grateful to the Senator
from Connecticut [Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>] for his admirable
argument on this question; and yet it seems to me, if
he will pardon me, that even in point of law he has not
stated the case as strongly in favor of this obligation as
it might be stated. It may be remembered, that, when
this discussion was closing, the other day, I ventured to
throw out the remark, that there were evidently two
classes of cases: the first, where enlistments in good
faith were made under the statute of 1861; and the
second, where they were made under the statute of
1862.</p>

<p>In point of law, it seems obvious, if enlistments were
made in good faith under the statute of 1861, and there
was no legal objection to those enlistments, then the
United States are bound. If, on the contrary, they were
made under the subsequent statute, then it is simply
a question of policy and expediency whether we shall
make this payment. The whole subject is open to discussion,&mdash;first,
in the light of sentiment, which may involve
expediency and policy, and, secondly, in the light
of law. I shall not say anything upon it in the first aspect,
except to make one remark,&mdash;that our country at
this moment can ill afford to take the responsibility of
refusing justice to colored soldiers whom it has allowed
to shed their blood in its cause. The soul repudiates
any such sacrifice,&mdash;for sacrifice it will be, at once of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
honor and of interest. I do not follow out this idea,
but pass at once to the second aspect, which I called
the question of law; and there I differ from my learned
friend from Connecticut, when I say that there are
certain colored regiments in the field who in point of
law are entitled to the full wages of thirteen dollars a
month.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Foster.</span> If the Senator will pardon me, I insisted on
that fact, and said they were enlisted, not under the law,
but under instructions from the Department, authorizing the
officers to enlist them on the same terms that white troops
were enlisted, which would be thirteen dollars per month.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well. I still understood the
Senator to imply that perhaps in point of law there
might be some doubt whether the Government was
liable for the thirteen dollars a month. I propose to
carry the argument a little further, and show, by calling
attention for one moment to the statutes,&mdash;not at any
great length,&mdash;that, under the statutes themselves, the
Government is obliged to pay certain regiments thirteen
dollars a month.</p>

<p>I begin with the Massachusetts fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth
regiments; and these may be taken as examples.
I have before me the actual order under which those
two regiments were raised.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">War Department, Washington City</span>,<br />
January 26, 1863.</p>

<p>“<i>Ordered</i>, That Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, is
authorized, until further orders, to raise such number of
volunteer companies of artillery for duty in the forts of
Massachusetts and elsewhere, and such corps of infantry
for the volunteer military service, as he may find convenient;
<i>such volunteers to be enlisted for three years</i>,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Mark, Sir, if you please, the period of service,&mdash;“for
three years,”&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“or until sooner discharged, <i>and may include persons of African
descent</i>, organized into separate corps. He will make the
usual needful requisitions on the appropriate staff bureaus
and officers for the proper transportation, organization, supplies,
subsistence, arms, and equipments, of such volunteers.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Edwin M. Stanton</span>, <i>Secretary of War</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, on the face of this order, the Governor of Massachusetts
is empowered to raise certain regiments in
the volunteer service of the United States for three
years. Under what statute? Under no other, surely,
than the statute of 1861, for it was under that statute
that the organization for three years was authorized. If
you come to the later statute&mdash;and to that I ask particular
attention&mdash;of July 17, 1862, which contains a
special provision with reference to African troops, you
will find that it is to raise troops for nine months.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 3.</span> <i>And be it further enacted</i>, That the President be,
and he is hereby, authorized, in addition to the volunteer
forces which he is now authorized by law to raise, to accept
the services of any number of volunteers, not exceeding one
hundred thousand, as infantry, for a period of nine months,
unless sooner discharged.”</p>

</div>

<p>And then, Sir, in section twelve of this same statute,
the President is further empowered to employ persons
of African descent. In section fifteen we come to the
question of pay.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That all persons who have
been or shall be hereafter enrolled in the service of the
United States under this Act”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<p>“Under this Act,”&mdash;an Act authorizing enrolments
for nine months, not for three years&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“shall receive the pay and rations now allowed by law to
soldiers, according to their respective grades: <i>Provided</i>, That
persons of African descent, <i>who under this law shall be employed</i>,
shall receive ten dollars per month and one ration,
three dollars of which monthly pay may be in clothing.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, Sir, you have the question precisely: Under
what statute were these enlistments made? Were they
under the nine months’ statute, or under the three years’
statute? To answer that question, look at the order of
the War Department:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Ordered</i>, That Governor Andrew, of Massachusetts, is
authorized, until further orders, to raise such number of
volunteer companies of artillery for duty in the forts of
Massachusetts and elsewhere, and such corps of infantry
for the volunteer military service, as he may find convenient;
<i>such volunteers to be enlisted for three years, or until
sooner discharged</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here are no nine months’ men. There is nobody
under the second statute, but all are clearly under the
first by the plain language of the order. And this is
none the less so, even if the second statute, so far as
Africans are concerned, may be interpreted to sanction
a longer term of enlistment.</p>

<p>Mark well, that “all persons who have been or <i>shall
be hereafter enrolled in the service of the United States</i>
under this Act shall receive the pay and rations now
allowed by law to soldiers.” (§ 15.) But were not the
soldiers of the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth Massachusetts
regiments “enrolled in the service of the United States”?
Unquestionably, if troops ever were enrolled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is the <i>proviso</i> that follows which causes the
mischief. “Persons of African descent, <i>who under this
law shall be employed</i>, shall receive ten dollars,” &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is said that these colored soldiers were “employed,”&mdash;that
is all,&mdash;not “enrolled,” but “employed”; and on
this distinction the promise of Governor Andrew in the
name of the National Government, and the honest expectations
of the soldiers, are set aside.</p>

<p>The order of the Secretary of War is for “volunteer
companies of artillery,” also for “corps of infantry,” “<i>to
be enlisted for three years</i>,” “and may include persons of
African descent.” The persons of African descent are
to be included in the artillery or infantry “enlisted.”
Such persons are in advance declared men to be <i>enlisted</i>.
And yet the argument which denies them their well-earned
wages asserts that they are only “employed,”
and not enlisted. But if they are “employed,” then
are the “corps of infantry” in which they are included
“employed” also.</p>

<p>To me the conclusion seems irresistible, on the face
of these facts, that these troops were enrolled or enlisted
under the earlier statute. It is clear that Governor Andrew
thought so at the time, and it is equally clear that
the troops themselves thought so at the time.</p>

<p>But there remains behind another question. Is there
anything in existing legislation to prevent the enlistment
of a colored person under the statute of 1861?
To this I answer positively in the negative, and I challenge
contradiction. There is no color in that statute.
There is no color in any statute raising troops for the
army of the United States, nor any color in any statute
raising sailors for the navy of the United States. Only
in our militia statutes do you find the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> “white.”
In all our army and navy statutes there is no such limitation.
The statute of 1861, therefore, in point of law
embraced all persons, whether black or white, and it
was entirely at the option of the President, before the
passage of the statute of 1862, to organize or receive
colored troops under that statute. He hesitated. I
regretted at the time his hesitation. I thought it an
error by which the country suffered. We endeavored
to repair that error by the amendment introduced by
the brave Senator from New York, who is no longer
here [Mr. <span class="smcap">King</span>], which you will find in the statutes
of 1862. But I doubt if any person at the time, who
had given attention to the subject, supposed this amendment
necessary, except as an encouragement to a policy
which the Government was too slow to adopt. For myself,
I remember well my own feelings in voting for it.
I accepted it as notice to the Administration that in the
opinion of Congress the time had come when colored
troops must be used. In point of law it was plain that
it could not stand in the way of an enrolment under
the earlier statute.</p>

<p>And the Secretary of War seems to have acted on
this interpretation; for, in undertaking to raise colored
troops, no allusion was made to the statute of 1862, but
the language of his order in every particular pointed to
the statute of 1861. Am I wrong, then, if I say that
in point of law these colored troops have just the same
right to the full pay of a soldier that any Senator on
this floor has to his compensation? It is by just as
good title, and as firm in the statute-book, as your own
pay, Sir.</p>

<p>I suggested, the other day, that there were two classes
of cases,&mdash;one where the enlistments had been made in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
good faith under the earlier statute, and a second class
where they had been made under the later statute; and
I suggested, that, if we were disposed to recognize the
difference between these two classes, it might afford a
solution to our present difficulties. I am not disposed,
on any ground of sentiment, to impose an unnecessary
tax upon the burdened treasury of my country, although
there is no tax required by justice that I would hesitate
to impose. If there are colored troops in our service,
who, at the time they were mustered, had no reason to
suppose that they were enlisted under the statute of
1861, who were led to believe that they came under the
statute of 1862, that is, for the pay of ten dollars, I am
not disposed to press for them any claim on ground of
sentiment,&mdash;that is, for the past. I take the past as it
is; but for the future I insist that they shall be put
upon an equality. True equality in the past is for the
National Government to redeem its pledges, whether
direct or only implied,&mdash;whether there is an absolute
promise, of which you have a record, or only an inference
or understanding, founded, it may be, in misconception,
but still embraced in good faith by innocent
parties. On this ground, at a proper moment, I shall
be ready to propose an amendment something like the
following, to come in immediately after the word “service”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That, with regard to all past service, it shall
appear to the satisfaction of the Secretary of War that such
persons, at the time of being mustered into service, were led
to suppose that they were enlisted under the Act of Congress
approved July 22, 1861, as volunteers in the army of the
United States.”</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Fessenden could not concur in Mr. Sumner’s construction of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>Act of 1862. Mr. Lane, of Indiana, thought, “if we place colored
troops hereafter on an equality with the white troops, it is surely as
much as they can ask, either from the justice or the generosity of this
Senate; for no man, in his sober senses, will say that their services
are worth as much, or that they are as good soldiers.” Mr. Sumner
replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I hope the Senator from Indiana
will pardon me, if I refer to him for one minute. He is
so uniformly generous and just that I was the more surprised,
when I listened to his remarks just now. I was
surprised at his lack of generosity and his lack of justice&mdash;he
will pardon me&mdash;toward these colored soldiers.
I was surprised&mdash;he will pardon me&mdash;at his injustice
to the State of Massachusetts. He spoke disparagingly
of the colored soldiers. He thought they had been paid
enough. He thought that the gallant blood shed on the
parapets of Fort Wagner had been paid enough; and he
failed to see that the men who died for us on that bloody
night, and were buried in the same grave with the devoted
colonel who led them, now stood alive in this
presence to plead for the equality of their race. How
can I help regret that the Senator was led into such
remark?</p>

<p>Also, in the ardor of his utterance,&mdash;he will pardon me
still further,&mdash;the Senator undertook to say, that, if we
entered on this payment, we should charge the Treasury
with some one or two hundred millions in addition to its
present burden. Why, Sir, that is an entire mistake.
Even if we pay everything contemplated by the resolution,
I am told that the whole will be little more than
a million: much, I admit, to charge unnecessarily upon
the Treasury, but not the very large sum which seemed
to fill the patriotic vision of the Senator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lane</span>, of Indiana. The Senator misunderstood my
statement altogether. My statement was, that, if we were
called upon now to go back and increase the pay of the colored
troops three dollars a month more than the law provided,
with the same propriety we might be called upon to
go back and increase the pay of our white soldiers because
they thought that their pay had not been enough; and that
would add to the burdens of the Treasury to a very large
amount.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I accept the correction gladly. Certainly
I have no disposition to press anything beyond
the meaning of the Senator. But he will allow me to
say that I was hardly mistaken in his argument. It
was, that we should charge the Treasury with a burden
it could ill bear. Now, if this money is due, let us
charge the Treasury with the burden; and that brings
me again to the direct question, Is not the money due?
The Senator denies it; but he will pardon me again, if
I say he hardly went into an argument on that head. I
repeat, then, is the money due? I dislike to trouble
the Senate by going over topics already too much discussed;
but I trust they will excuse me, if I state the
case yet once more. On many accounts I confess a
special interest in it; not the least is that I would have
my country above doing injustice, least of all injustice
to people of a race too long crushed by injustice.</p>

<p>The argument need not be long. In the first place,
the statute of 1861 contains no words which can be interpreted
in any way to exclude the enrolment of persons
of color under it. I challenge any Senator to mention
a single word in that statute authorizing any such
exclusion. You have, then, the statute in the case. That
is the first point. Then you have the order from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
Secretary of War to Governor Andrew, authorizing an
enrolment for three years, making no discrimination
between persons of African descent and white soldiers.
That is the second point. You have, in the third place,
the open promises and pledges of Governor Andrew, under
that order, and for the time being the agent of the
United States, solemnly promising the full pay of thirteen
dollars a month to these colored persons as soldiers
of the United States. And, in the last place, you have
the very terms of enlistment subscribed by these soldiers
at the time of enlistment, which I read the other day,
where it is expressly stated that they entered into service
under the statute of 1861.</p>

<p>These four points,&mdash;the statute of 1861, the order of
the Secretary, the promise of Governor Andrew in behalf
of the United States, and the terms of enlistment,&mdash;all
these make a case by which, as it seems to me, the Government
is bound. In face of these, how can it be said
that these colored troops were “employed” under the
statute of 1862? There is no ingenuity of interpretation
which can place them there.</p>

<p>That I am not mistaken in the facts on which I found
this argument is apparent from a letter which I hold in
my hand, written by one of these soldiers, now on Morris
Island. I content myself with a brief extract.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the month of February, 1863, Governor John A.
Andrew announced that he had permission from the War
Department to raise a regiment of infantry to be composed
of men of color. Enlisting began immediately, and the fifty-fourth
regiment was filled to overflowing in three months.
The only inducement he offered to these men was an acknowledgment
of their manhood; for he promised that
the United States Government would treat them, in <i>every</i>
particular, the same as other volunteer regiments from the
State of Massachusetts.”</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lane.</span> Will the Senator pardon me a moment just
there?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lane.</span> They were to be treated in every respect as
the volunteer troops from Massachusetts. Will the Senator
contend that the commissioned officers of colored regiments
might be drawn from the colored troops themselves, after
the passage of the law of 1862? Was not that a disparity?
Was that treating them like other troops?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Of course the order is applicable simply to
the enlisted men. It is not applicable to the officers.</p>

<p>The letter goes on to say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The enlistment rolls signed by these men bound them
to obey the President,” &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>How?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In pursuance of the law passed in July, 1861, calling
for volunteers.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such was the understanding. By this lure you won
these men to the field of sacrifice.</p>

<p>I have already said too much, but before I sit down
I cannot forget that the Senator from Indiana, in his
impetuous movement, brushed against the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. I do not remember his precise
words, nor do I care to remember them. But he
more than intimated that there was on the part of this
State something else than a patriotic motive in pressing
this obligation. I think he said this whole effort is to
save the payment of this extra money. Does not the
Senator know that Massachusetts has already provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
for the payment of this sum, so far as its own two regiments
are concerned, and that those regiments have refused
to receive it? These colored troops declare that
they were enlisted as soldiers of the United States, and
as such are entitled to the pay of soldiers of the United
States from the Government of the United States. If
it be wrong to maintain their claim, then is Massachusetts
wrong, then am I wrong. If the claim is maintained
earnestly, it is because, both in law and in sentiment,
and on every ground of policy or expediency, it
commends itself to those who represent Massachusetts.
And now, since this State has been called in question,
I shall not content myself with merely giving my own
opinions and arguments, but I ask you to listen to her
honored Governor.</p>

<p>In an official communication to the Legislature of
Massachusetts, Governor Andrew has discussed this
whole question with his accustomed lucidity and thoroughness.
Here is something of what he says.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To my own mind, the right of these men, under the
existing statutes, to the lawful pay and allowances of volunteers
is demonstrably clear. But if it is doubtful, it is
agreed, I believe, in all quarters, that it will be the duty
and the pleasure of Congress to embrace an early opportunity
to prevent by positive legislation the continuance of
that doubt. Meantime I must embrace the earliest occasion
to invoke the Legislature of Massachusetts to render
justice to the men of these regiments beyond the possibility
of a doubt, by the appropriation of the needful means out of
our own treasury until the National Congress or the Executive
Department shall correct the error.”<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>The Governor, after considering some details of the
argument, proceeds as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think there can be no proposition of law more clear
than this, namely, that colored men are competent to be
enlisted into the regular army of the United States, into the
volunteer army of the United States, into the navy of the
United States, and to be employed in any arm of either
service.</p>

<p>“The Military Enlistment Law of 1814 required only that
the recruit shall be a ‘free, effective, able-bodied man, between
the ages of eighteen and fifty years.’ (<i>See Act of
December 10, 1814.</i>) It did not require a man to be under
forty-five, nor a citizen, nor white, in which three respects
it differs from the old Militia Act. The Naval Act of 1813
is not less clear.”<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is the statement of the Governor on this question
in point of law. At the time these regiments were
mustered into the service he believed that he was acting
legally under the statutes of the United States. He so
instructed these men; and these men naturally believed
him, and gave themselves, generously, nobly, beautifully,
to the public service. Will the country now disown
them? Will the country now fasten a ban upon them,
and lead them to say in their hearts that they have been
duped?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 13th, the subject being still before the Senate, Mr. Sumner
offered the proviso of which he had already given notice at the close
of his first remarks; but, after debate, he withdrew it at the request
of Mr. Wilson, who, seeing the opposition to the joint resolution, proposed
to abandon all that part making it retroactive. In withdrawing
it, Mr. Sumner again vindicated it, saying, in conclusion:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span> “I am
unwilling to withdraw the proposition. I shall do it, if my colleague
desires it. At any rate, I should rather, for my own satisfaction, have
a vote upon it.”</p>

<p>In the debate that ensued, Mr. Reverdy Johnson said: “If the
Governor of Massachusetts has made a promise which the law did
not authorize, if he has created, as between the Massachusetts soldiers
and the Governor of Massachusetts, an obligation which ought to be
redeemed, let Massachusetts redeem it.” “They have passed a law
to redeem it,” said Mr. Fessenden, “but these regiments refuse to receive
it from Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson moved to insert words making the resolution applicable
only “from and after the first day of January, 1864,” which was agreed
to. After debate, Mr. Sumner again moved his proviso, which was
lost,&mdash;Yeas 16, Nays 21. Other amendments were moved, and the
debate continued for days.</p>

<p>February 23d, Mr. Davis moved as a substitute three resolutions,&mdash;that
all negroes and mulattoes, by whatever term designated, in the
military service of the United States, be discharged and disarmed, and
also providing for payment to loyal owners on account of slaves taken
into the service. Lost,&mdash;Yeas 7, Nays 30.</p>

<p>Mr. Collamer, of Vermont, having moved an amendment providing
for a certain class of cases, Mr. Sumner, February 25th, brought forward
his amendment in the following terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided, also</i>, That all persons whose papers of enlistment shall show
that they were enlisted under the Act of Congress of July, 1861, shall receive
from the time of their enlistment the pay promised by that statute.”</p>

</div>

<p>In proposing this again, he said: “I believe, if any persons have
enlisted in the national service, and, through any ambiguity or misinterpretation
of legislation, their rights have been drawn in question, it
belongs to Congress, as guardian and conservator of the rights of every
citizen, to see that they have the proper remedy.” The amendment
was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 18.</p>

<p>February 29th, Mr. Fessenden addressed the Senate in explanation
of his position. He had been from the beginning in favor of placing
colored soldiers on the same footing as white; but he objected to the
attempt to provide for exceptional cases on this general bill, and he
asked, “whether we should have had such an uproar throughout the
country, if this amendment had been in regard to three or four or more
white regiments, to go back and pay them an additional sum from the
time of their enlistment, and the principle had been objected to.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner, in reply, reviewed the case, and in conclusion said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span></p>

<p>From the question of law I pass to that other question
which occupied the attention of the Senator from
Maine, as to when and where we should meet this obligation.
He says, Bring in a separate bill. That was
said the other day. I say, Meet it whenever it appears.
It is in itself a case of such absolute and overwhelming
justice that the Senate ought not to postpone it for a
single day,&mdash;especially ought not to postpone it, when
it has under consideration a bill so entirely germane as
the present. If it were a bill concerning the Pacific
Railroad or the sale of gold, it might be questionable
whether the proposition should be ingrafted upon it;
but, as it is a bill to put colored troops on an equality
with other troops in the national service, I say that the
pending proposition is perfectly germane, and, being in
itself of commanding justice, ought not to be postponed.
It is a common device of enemies to object to a measure
on a particular bill. For myself, I wish it understood
that I am for the proposition on any bill and at
any time.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Then, on motion of Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, the joint resolution was
recommitted to the Committee on Military Affairs.</p>

<p>March 2d, Mr. Wilson reported a new bill, in lieu of the original
joint resolution so much discussed, which, besides the provision in the
joint resolution, contained an additional section in substantial conformity
with Mr. Sumner’s proviso, giving to all persons of color enlisted and
mustered into the service of the United States the pay allowed by law
to other volunteers in the service, from the date of their muster, if it
had been pledged or promised to them by any officer or person, who, in
making such pledge or promise, acted by authority of the War Department;
and the Secretary of War was to determine any question of fact
arising under this provision.</p>

<p>March 8th, the bill being under consideration, Mr. Davis moved an
additional section, giving to loyal owners of slaves taken into service
compensation to be determined by commissioners appointed by the Circuit
Court of the United States.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
<p>March 9th, Mr. Davis made an elaborate speech vindicating property
in slaves.</p>

<p>March 10th, after further debate, the additional section of Mr. Davis
was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 6, Nays 31,&mdash;and also another amendment moved
by him. The bill then passed the Senate,&mdash;Yeas 31, Nays 6. In the
House of Representatives other matters were substituted for the provisions
which had occupied the attention of the Senate, as the object
was already accomplished in another way.</p>

<p>April 22d, the Army Appropriation Bill being under consideration,
Mr. Wilson moved, as an amendment, the bill to equalize the pay of
soldiers which had passed the Senate. Mr. Fessenden thought that
“the measure ought to be passed, and passed at once.” If the Senate
would waive the objection to putting it on the Appropriation Bill, he
would not object. The amendment was agreed to,&mdash;Yeas 31, Nays 5.</p>

<p>Then followed another series of struggles. The House of Representatives
made amendments which were disagreed to by the Senate. Then
came no less than three different Committees of Conference. The report
of the last Committee, which was made June 10th, contained the following
substitute for the Senate amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That all persons of color who were free on the nineteenth day of April,
1861, and who have been enlisted and mustered into the military service of
the United States, shall, from the time of their enlistment, be entitled to receive
the pay, bounty, and clothing allowed to such persons by the laws
existing at the time of their enlistment. And the Attorney-General of the
United States is hereby authorized to determine any question of law arising
under this provision. And if the Attorney-General aforesaid shall determine
that any of such enlisted persons are entitled to receive any pay, bounty, or
clothing in addition to what they have already received, the Secretary of
War shall make all necessary regulations to enable the pay department to
make payment in accordance with such determination.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner observed that the report did not seem to settle the question
in issue; that, if he were merely looking after the interests of his
own constituents and the regiments organized in Massachusetts, he
might rest satisfied; but that he was unwilling to sanction a settlement
which did not embrace all the colored troops. The debate extended
into the next day, when Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>I stated last night that in my opinion this report
undertook to conclude something, but did not conclude
it. On further consideration, I am satisfied that I was
not much mistaken. It is a conclusion in which nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
is concluded. I may say, too, that it is not entirely
creditable to Congress, and, so far as I now accept the
result, it will be with much reluctance. It would have
better become Congress to recognize a solemn obligation
toward those now baring their breasts for us in battle,
and falling on the ramparts of the enemy, rather than
question their title to pay as soldiers, which I believe
as strong for them as for any white soldiers. I regret
sincerely that their title has not been positively recognized
in the text of a statute; but, after effort in both
branches, and the appointment of several committees of
conference, such recognition has failed. I despair of obtaining
it, at least on the present bill. On that account
I am induced to look critically at the proposition before
us, to see whether this affords any measure of justice.
In one sense it affords nothing; and I believe the Senator
from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>], who was on the last
committee, will not differ from me on that point; but
it does distinctly and unequivocally refer the question
to the judgment of the Attorney-General of the United
States. Substantially Congress agrees to take his opinion.
He has already given it. I have it in my hand,
in a communication dated April 23, 1864, on a case
submitted by the President.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not know that any rule of law, constitutional or
statutory, ever prohibited the acceptance, organization, and
muster of ‘persons of African descent’ into the military service
of the United States as enlisted men or volunteers. But
whatever doubt might have existed on the subject had been
fully resolved before this order was issued, by the 11th section
of the Act of July 17, 1862, chap. 195, which authorized
the President to employ as many persons of African descent
as he might deem necessary and proper for the suppression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>of the Rebellion, and for that purpose to organize
and use them in such manner as he might judge best for the
public welfare.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And then again he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have already said that I knew of no provision of law,
constitutional or statutory, which prohibited the acceptance
of persons of African descent into the military service of the
United States; and if they could be lawfully accepted as
private soldiers, so also might they be lawfully accepted as
commissioned officers, if otherwise qualified therefor. But
the express power conferred on the President by the 11th
section of the Act of July 17, 1862, chap. 195, before cited,
to employ this class of persons for the suppression of the
Rebellion as he may judge best for the public welfare, furnishes
all needed sanction of law to the employment of a
colored chaplain for a volunteer regiment of his own race.”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

</div>

<p>By the report before the Senate, it is declared as follows:
“And the Attorney-General is hereby authorized
to determine any question of law arising under this provision.”
In the full confidence that we shall at last,
through the Attorney-General, obtain that justice which
Congress has denied, I consent to give my vote for the
report.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The report was concurred in.<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> The Attorney-General, Mr. Bates,

<h2><a name="OPENING_OF_THE_STREET-CARS_TO_COLORED" id="OPENING_OF_THE_STREET-CARS_TO_COLORED"></a>OPENING OF THE STREET-CARS TO COLORED
PERSONS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speeches in the Senate, on various Propositions, February 10,
March 17, June 21, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The opening of the street-cars in Washington constitutes a special
chapter of effort, which, beyond its local influence, was important as
an example to the country.</p>

<p>February 27, 1863, the Senate having under consideration the bill
to authorize the Alexandria and Washington Railroad Company to
extend their road across the Potomac River and through the city of
Washington to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad station, Mr. Sumner
moved an amendment in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And provided, also</i>, That no person shall be excluded from the cars on
account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>In making this motion, he called attention to what seemed to him a
new illustration of the barbarism of Slavery. An aged colored person
had been excluded from the cars and dropped in the mud. He thought
the incident discreditable, and that it was the duty of Congress to interfere.
The following dialogue then ensued.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howe</span> (of Wisconsin). I should like to ask the Senator from Massachusetts,
as a question of law, whether, if this railroad company, being
common carriers, should drop any person or refuse to carry any person who
offered them their fare, they would not be liable as the law now stands,
without any express enactment?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> If you ask me the question as a lawyer, I should say they
would be liable; but the experience here, as I believe, is, that this liability
is not recognized. The Senator knows well, that, under the influence of
Slavery, human rights are disregarded, and those principles of law which
he recognizes are set aside. Therefore it becomes the duty of Congress to
interfere and specially declare them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Howe.</span> Would the effect of the amendment be any more than a reënactment
of the existing law?</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> That was said of the Wilmot Proviso, as the Senator will
remember.</p>

</div>

<p>The question being taken by yeas and nays, resulted, Yeas 19, Nays
18; so the amendment was agreed to. It was concurred in by the
House, and approved by the President, March 3, 1863.</p>

<p>This provision, though applicable to a single road, seemed to decide
the principle. But it was not so regarded by the other railroads in
Washington, which continued to exclude colored persons, often under
painful circumstances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 10, 1864, Mr. Sumner called attention to this subject by
the following resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the District of Columbia be directed
to consider the expediency of further providing by law against the exclusion
of colored persons from the equal enjoyment of all railroad privileges in the
District of Columbia.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner explained the resolution.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;It is necessary that I should
call attention to a recent outrage which has occurred
in this District. I do it with great hesitation.
At one moment I was inclined to keep silence, believing
that the good name of our country required silence;
but since it has already found its way into the journals,
I cannot doubt that it ought to find its way into this
Chamber.</p>

<p>An officer of the United States, with the commission
of Major, with the national uniform, has been pushed
from a car on Pennsylvania Avenue for no other offence
than that he was black. Now, Sir, I desire to say openly
that we had better give up railroads in the national capital,
if we cannot have them without such an outrage
upon humanity, and upon the national character. An
incident like that, Sir, is worse at this moment than
defeat in battle. It makes enemies for our cause abroad,
and sows distrust. I hope, therefore, that the Committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
on the District of Columbia,&mdash;I know the disposition
of my honorable friend, the Chairman of that
Committee,&mdash;in the bills we are to consider relative
to the railroads in this District, will take care that such
safeguards are established as will prevent the repetition
of any such wrong.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In reply to Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, Mr. Sumner spoke again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I am sure that the Senator from
Indiana [Mr. <span class="smcap">Hendricks</span>] is mistaken in regard to the
provision for colored people. There may be here and
there, now and then, once in a long interval of time, a
car which colored people may enter; but any person
traversing the avenue will see that those cars appear
very rarely; and if any person takes the trouble to acquaint
himself with the actual condition of things, he
will learn that there are great abuses and hardships,
particularly among women, growing out of this outrage.
I use plain language, Sir, for it is an outrage. It is a
disgrace to this city, and a disgrace also to the National
Government, which permits it under its eyes. It is a
mere offshoot of the Slavery which, happily, we have
banished from Washington.</p>

<p>Now go back to the facts on which I predicated my
motion. The Senator from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>] has referred
to the colored officer. I have in my hand his
letter, addressed to his military superior, making a report
of the case, and, as it is very brief, I will read it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Washington, D. C.</span>, February 1, 1864.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to report that I have been obstructed
in getting to the Court this morning by the conductor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>of car No. 32 of the Fourteenth Street line of the
city railway.</p>

<p>“I started from my lodgings to go to the hospital I formerly
had charge of, to get some notes of the case I was to
give evidence in, and hailed the car at the corner of Fourteenth
and I Streets. It was stopped for me, and, when
I attempted to enter, the conductor pulled me back, and
informed me that I must ride on the front with the driver,
as it was against the rules for colored persons to ride inside.
I told him I would not ride on the front, and he said I
should not ride at all. He then ejected me from the platform,
and at the same time gave orders to the driver to go
on. I have, therefore, been compelled to walk the distance
in the mud and rain, and have also been delayed in my
attendance upon the Court.</p>

<p>“I therefore most respectfully request that the offender
may be arrested and brought to punishment.</p>

<p class="sig">“I remain, Sir, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">A. T. Augusta</span>, M. B.,<br />
“<i>Surgeon Seventh U. S. Colored Troops</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“<span class="smcap">Captain C. W. Clippington</span>, <i>Judge Advocate</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>In my opinion, the writer of this letter had just as much
right in that car as the Senator from Indiana, and it was
as great an outrage to eject him as it would be to eject
that Senator. I go further, and I say&mdash;pardon the
illustration&mdash;that the ejection of that Senator would
not bring upon this capital half the shame that the
ejection of this colored officer necessarily brings upon
the capital. I do not mean, of course, to make the remark
personal; but, as the Senator from Indiana has
entered into this discussion, and chooses to vindicate
this inhumanity, I allude to him personally.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 30, Nays 10.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
<p>February 24th, Mr. Willey, of West Virginia, from the Committee
on the District of Columbia, made a report in the following terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Act entitled ‘An Act to incorporate the Washington and Georgetown
Railroad Company,’ approved May 17, 1862, makes no distinction as
to passengers over said road, or as to any of the privileges of said road, on
account of the color of the passenger, and that, in the opinion of the Committee,
colored persons are entitled to all the privileges of said road which
any other persons have, and to all the remedies for any denial or breach of
such privileges which belong to any other persons. The Committee, therefore,
ask to be discharged from the further consideration of the premises.”</p>

</div>

<p>February 25th, Mr. Sumner called attention to this report, and moved
to reconsider the vote accepting it. Mr. Grimes stated that “the Committee
hold that every person has a right to ride in the cars, and that
a colored person has the same remedies open to him for any infringement
of his rights by the Company as anybody else.” Mr. Sumner
then inquired, “whether it was the understanding of the Committee
that the ejection of a colored person from a car was illegal.” Mr. Grimes
replied, “As I understood it.” Mr. Sumner. “That the ejection was
illegal?” Mr. Grimes. “Yes, Sir.” Mr. Reverdy Johnson united in
this conclusion. Mr. Willey said: “The law is now full and perfect
in all its provisions and adaptations to secure the colored persons in the
enjoyment of the privileges of this railroad.” Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts,
said: “I think in law he is right, but in practice it is an
undeniable fact that the spirit of the old law and the old practices still
lingers to some extent here in the District.” Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware,
followed: “I most heartily approve of the action of the officer on
board that railroad-car. I think he deserved the thanks of the community.
When these negroes go about sticking their heads into railroad-cars,
and among white people, and into the Supreme Court Room,
I think an officer is perfectly right in telling them they have no business
there.” Mr. Sumner remarked as follows.</p>

</div>

<p>After the declarations made to-day, I am, at least
for the present, satisfied, and shall not proceed further
with my motion. I was particularly grateful to the
Senator from Maryland for his very explicit statement
of the law. I do not doubt he is entirely right. It has
always been my opinion. I am glad to have it confirmed
by that distinguished Senator and lawyer. I am also
grateful to the Senator from West Virginia, who made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the report, and who has so explicitly stated his own
convictions, and, as I understand him, also the unanimous
opinion of the Committee, to the effect that these
people have legal rights precisely as white persons to
the full enjoyment of all the privileges of the railroad
in this District. If they have such legal rights, they are
at this moment unquestionably exposed to what I must
call outrage. If a white person were ejected from the
cars on account of his skin, we should all feel that it
was an outrage. Is it any less an outrage because the
person ejected is simply guilty of a different skin? I
confess, that, to my mind, it is a greater outrage, because
obligations are greater in proportion to the humility and
weakness of those with whom we deal.</p>

<p>But, Sir, I have no desire to proceed further in this
question. I am for the present satisfied. My hope,
however, is, that the railroad corporation will at once
take notice, and act according to law.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner then withdrew his motion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the face of this report, the exclusion of colored persons continued,
often attended by intolerable outrage. Aged persons were thrust into
the street. At last an opportunity occurred of bringing this question
to a vote in the Senate.</p>

<p>March 16, 1864, the Senate had under consideration a bill to incorporate
the Metropolitan Railroad Company in the District of Columbia,
sometimes known as the F Street Road, when Mr. Sumner moved the
following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That there shall be no regulation excluding any person from
any car on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>A debate ensued, in which Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, and Mr.
Reverdy Johnson, of Maryland, earnestly opposed the amendment.
March 17th, the latter, while acknowledging that there was nothing
in the bill giving “authority to exclude passengers at all,” insisted
that colored persons so excluded should be remitted to the courts, and
he did not see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span> “why it is necessary to provide more special guaranties
for the black man than are provided for the white man”; “if the
black man is improperly excluded from one of these cars, … he has
the right to go to the courts and seek his remedy there, and the white
man has no greater right”; that Mr. Sumner “might just as well propose
to pass a law providing that these black men and black women
shall have the same right to visit the Presidential mansion on public
occasions as the white men and the white women”; and he then discussed
the questions of social and political equality, insisting that
those just escaped from Slavery “are not the people to exercise the
elective franchise, and to mix in society with the educated classes, of
which and from which the public councils of the country should always
be composed and taken.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The question before the Senate is
very simple. It is plain as one of the Ten Commandments.
But the Senator from Maryland, with that nimbleness
of speech which belongs to him, while undertaking
to discuss it, has ranged over a very extensive
field. He has treated the Senate to a discourse on almost
everything, and something else also,&mdash;the elective
franchise, social privileges of the Presidential mansion,
the equality of races, the intermarriage of races, the state
of Slavery in Maryland, also in some other States, and
then the state of Slavery generally. Now, Sir, I shall
not follow him on any of those topics. My desire is to
present the precise point in issue. The Senate will then
be prepared to vote.</p>

<p>But the Senator from Maryland will allow me to
remind him that he seems to exhibit a rare inconsistency,&mdash;first,
in declaring the absolute right of colored
people to a seat in the cars, and then arguing, that, on
every consideration of social life and of principle, they
ought not to be admitted to any such privilege. The
two parts do not go together. If colored people have the
legal right to enter these cars, why does the Senator argue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
that they ought not to have that right? I agree with
the Senator in the first point. They have the legal right
to enter these cars, and the proprietors are trespassers,
when they exclude them. Here I agreed with the Senator
the other day. To my mind it is clear, because any
other conclusion authorizes a corporation to establish a
caste offensive to religion and humanity, injurious to a
whole race now dwelling among us, and bringing shame
upon our country.</p>

<p>The Senator asks, why, as I accept this conclusion, do
I bring forward the present proposition? To this there
are two answers, either of which is sufficient. The first
is, that in the last railroad statute passed by Congress
this provision was introduced, and I have heard of no
complaint or trouble from it. In that now before us let
us introduce the same provision, and make the two uniform.
That is one reason. But the better reason is,
that, while, beyond all question, colored persons have
the legal right, even without this amendment, yet that
legal right has been drawn in question. In point of
fact, they are excluded from the cars. The Senator
from Maryland refers to one case, because it has become
well known. I am familiar with many other
cases. They are brought to my attention almost daily.
There is, then, at this moment, an existing abuse. Colored
persons are kept out of their rights. But we cannot
afford, at this crisis of our history, to sanction injustice.
Every such act rises in judgment against us, and
hangs on the movements of our armies, checking even
the currents of victory.</p>

<p>The Senator admits their rights, but he says, Let them
go to the courts. Sir, what is that for a poor, humble
person, without means and without consideration? The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
Senator knows something of the law’s delay and the
law’s expense; and I ask him whether it is just to subject
an oppressed people to this additional oppression,
when, by a few words, Congress, now in session, can
overturn the wrong.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Johnson.</span> Will the Senator permit me to ask him a
question by way of reply? Suppose the amendment is
adopted; if it will not give them a greater right than they
have now, and the Company refuse to let them enjoy the
right, what is their remedy? They must go to the courts.
I suppose there is no other remedy. You do not provide that
the charter shall be forfeited at once.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I know very well that they may, in
the last resort, be obliged to go to the courts; but I
know that it will be more difficult for the Company to
exclude them in the face of a positive statute than when
their rights are simply founded on <i>inference</i>. The positive
words which I propose leave no loophole for doubt.
They must be obeyed.</p>

<p>There is nothing more common in legislation than, in
case of doubt as to the meaning of a statute, or of the
Common Law, to remove it by what is well known as
a “declaratory” statute. I have in my hands a work
of authority, which the Senator knows well, Dwarris on
Statutes, from which I read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And first of declaratory acts. These are made where the
old custom of the kingdom is almost fallen into disuse or
become disputable, in which case the Parliament has thought
proper, <i>in perpetuum rei testimonium</i>, and for avoiding all
doubts and difficulties, to declare what the Common Law is
and ever hath been.”<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Are not these words completely applicable to the case
before us? What should be the custom is, according to
these words, “almost fallen into disuse, or become disputable.”
I say, therefore, again, following these words,
“for avoiding all doubts and difficulties,” it is the duty
of Congress “to declare” what the law of the land is.</p>

<p>Again, in another place, this same authority, speaking
still further of declaratory statutes, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Acts to explain laws are properly acts of interpretation
by legislative authority,&mdash;or, to borrow an expression from
the writers on the Roman Law, they are acts of <i>authentic interpretation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I ask the attention of the Senator to the expression,
“they are acts of <i>authentic interpretation</i>.” Now, Sir,
what I desire is, that the Senate shall give an authentic
interpretation to the law. To do this it is not needful
to range over the whole field of history, of morals, or of
politics, in imitation of the Senator, or to discuss the
equality of races, or their fortunes in the future; but it
is enough for us to become acquainted with the existing
abuse, every day under our own eyes, in the streets of
this capital, and then to apply the remedy. Beyond all
question, there is an abuse. The remedy is simple, and
I cannot doubt that it will be effective.</p>

<p>Listening to the objections which this measure has
encountered, I am reminded of those so often brought
against the Wilmot Proviso. Sometimes it was said
that Slavery could not go into the Territories without
positive statute, and that therefore the prohibition was
unnecessary. But it generally happened that those who
opposed the positive prohibition were indifferent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
great question. No, Sir; there can be but one true rule.
It is this: the rights of colored persons must be placed
under the protection of positive statute, warning their
oppressors against continued outrage.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The question being taken on Mr. Sumner’s amendment, it was
adopted,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 17. The House concurred, and the President
approved the bill.</p>

<p>Thus was another road brought within the sphere of this prohibition.
But the exclusion was continued on the main road in Pennsylvania
Avenue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 21st, the Senate having under consideration a bill to amend
the charter of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company,
Mr. Sumner moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And provided, further</i>, That there shall be no exclusion of any person
from any car on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>Debate ensued. Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, thought “the amendment
ought not to be adopted.” Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, thought it
tended to depreciate the value of investments made on the faith of former
legislation. Mr. Willey, of West Virginia, declared his opposition,
saying, “It is a matter to be regulated by the interests of the Company,
the convenience of the people, and especially the tastes of the people.”
Mr. Powell, of Kentucky, said: “If the Senator from Massachusetts
is such a vehement friend of this down-trodden race, as he is a lawyer,
why did he not undertake their case, and propose to argue it for them
before the courts? That would have indicated that he really felt for
the negro.… The Senator shows his devotion to this down-trodden
race here, and only in words.… The Senator’s staple is this fanatical
idea. He wants this little hobby to ride through Massachusetts on,
and to feed a fanatical flame there. He can fool nobody here with
this kind of thing. Take the negro out of the Senator’s vocabulary,
and, rich as it is, it would be exceedingly barren.” Mr. Trumbull, of
Illinois, also opposed the amendment. In the course of the debate,
Mr. Sumner spoke as follows, especially in reply to Mr. Trumbull.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senator from Illinois [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>], in former days, was a sincere, intelligent,
devoted supporter of the Wilmot Proviso. As I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
that Proviso, it was simply a prohibition of Slavery
in the Territories. Now I know not whether the
Senator held, as I did, that, even without that prohibition,
yet, by a strict interpretation of the Constitution,
Slavery could not go into the Territories. I presume
he did; most of us did. For myself, I held it resolutely
and sincerely. I always regarded the Wilmot Proviso,
if the Constitution were properly interpreted, as mere
surplusage, sheer supererogation; and yet I never hesitated,
in season or out of season, to vindicate it; and I
believe the Senator never hesitated, in season or out
of season, to do the same. I remember that my earliest
admiration of that Senator was founded on his brave
and able support of that very prohibition. Not then
was he deterred from a humane provision because without
it, according to his interpretation of the Constitution,
Slavery could not enter the Territories. Nor was
he deterred because the provision might be offensive to
persons of weak nerves. No, Sir; openly and courageously
he maintained the principle that Slavery must
be prohibited. And on the same principle&mdash;if I may
pass from great things to smaller, I admit, but not small&mdash;I
insist that this proviso should also be adopted.</p>

<p>Our experience shows that the law as the Senator
expounds it is not so accepted by this railroad corporation.
He knows as well as I that colored persons are
daily insulted. Some of these victims will compare in
respectability of conduct with any whom I now have the
honor to address. My colleague alluded to a colored
clergyman whom he saw thrust out only the other day.
We know of an officer of the United States, wearing the
national uniform, thrust out; and the Senator from Illinois
will allow all these things to be done, and not interfere.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
He tells us that it is contrary to law, and yet
he allows it to proceed under the very eyes of the Senate.
Sir, I insist that the Senate, when such outrage
occurs, shall show that it has power, and is willing to
exercise it on the side of justice.</p>

<p>But the Senator reminds us that in other days the
Fugitive Act was passed here, and made especially offensive;
and he pleads with us not to imitate that bad
example, by introducing anything that may be offensive.
I do not like the comparison of the Senator. Does he
not know well that everything introduced into the Fugitive
Slave Bill was in the interest of Slavery, and
contrary to every sentiment of humanity, and that it
was intended to give offence? The proposition now
moved is opposite in character. It is to sustain the principles
of humanity, to uphold human rights, to vindicate
human equality, and with no purpose of offence,&mdash;none,
not the least. The illustration of the Senator is entirely
out of place. True it is that in those other days we
were offended, and it was part of the hardships to which
we were exposed. As, in the days which preceded our
Revolution, the British officers said they would cram
the stamps down the throats of the American people, so,
in the same malignant spirit, the Slave-Masters insisted
upon cramming Slavery down the throats of the Senate
and the country. There was nothing but brutality then.
Slavery in all its features is bad, but one of its most
odious manifestations was the revolting insensibility
to every sentiment of delicacy and humanity which it
created in its supporters.</p>

<p>Sir, the Senator from Illinois knows well that it is
in a very different spirit that propositions like the present
are brought forward. It is always in the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of human rights, and I need not say to that Senator, so
far as I am concerned, with no other purpose than that
patent in the proposition itself, and with no idea of
offending any human being,&mdash;on the contrary, with a
desire to avoid offence, if I possibly can. In that spirit
I wish to do my duty on this floor. I would never
give offence to any one, here or elsewhere, if I knew
how to avoid it, while in all things I faithfully discharge
my public duty.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The debate continued, when Mr. Grimes, of Iowa, said he should
like to have Mr. Sumner answer one question. “Suppose we pass this
amendment and put it into the law, and the Company goes on and does
exactly as it has been doing, excluding these men, what are these colored
men going to do? Have they not got to go to law then? Will
they not be compelled to enforce their rights in court? Will they not
be compelled to employ lawyers? If that be so, what advantage will
it be to them to adopt this amendment under the present condition of
things?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I will answer. Because the Company will not dare
to continue this outrage in the face and eyes of a positive provision of
statute. That is the answer.</p>

<p>On the Yeas and Nays, the amendment was lost,&mdash;Yeas 14, Nays
16,&mdash;several Republicans uniting with the Democrats against it.</p>

<p>At the next stage of the bill, Mr. Sumner renewed his amendment,
when it was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 17, Nays 16. The bill passed the Senate,
and was the subject of conference between the two Houses, but it never
became a law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>January 17, 1865, the Senate having under consideration the bill to
incorporate the Baltimore and Washington Depot and Potomac Ferry
Railway Company, Mr. Sumner moved the same amendment, which
was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 24, Nays 6. This bill was passed by the Senate,
but it never became a law.</p>

<p>February 4, 1865, the Senate having under consideration a bill to
amend the charter of the Metropolitan Railroad Company, Mr. Sumner
moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the provision prohibiting any exclusion from any car on account
of color, already applicable to the Metropolitan Railroad, is hereby extended
to every other railroad in the District of Columbia.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>
<p>This amendment became necessary in order to reach the Washington
and Georgetown Railroad Company. It was opposed by Mr. Dixon,
of Connecticut, Mr. Conness, of California, and Mr. Hale, of New
Hampshire, the last regarding it in the nature of general legislation
on a private act. Mr. Sumner replied, that it was needed, in order to
bring the Metropolitan Railroad on an equality with the other roads,
inasmuch as Congress had already imposed the prohibition upon that
road; and, secondly, that it was germane, inasmuch as the Senate might
engraft upon any railroad charter any proposition, special or general,
concerning the subject-matter.</p>

<p>The amendment was lost,&mdash;Yeas 19, Nays 20.</p>

<p>At the next stage of the bill, Mr. Sumner renewed his amendment.
February 6th, Mr. Dixon, Chairman of the Committee on the District
of Columbia, withdrew his opposition, saying: “I opposed it on the
ground that it seemed to conflict with the rights of another Company,
not now before the Senate [the Washington and Georgetown Railroad
Company]; but since that time I have seen the managers and controllers
of that Company, and find that they are unwilling to contend on
this subject with what they consider to be the public opinion. They
therefore make no objection to it, and I shall make none.”</p>

<p>The amendment was adopted,&mdash;Yeas 26, Nays 10. The bill as
amended passed the House and was approved by the President, so
that it became illegal for any railroad in the District of Columbia
to exclude any person from any car on account of color.</p>

<p>The Washington and Georgetown Railroad did not promptly recognize
the law. Colored persons were excluded from their cars, when
Mr. Sumner addressed a letter to the President of the road, calling
attention to the contumacy of the Company, and announcing his purpose,
if it continued, to move, at the next session of Congress, the forfeiture
of the charter. At the same time he addressed a communication
to the District Attorney, asking him to proceed against the Company.
At last the law was recognized, and from that date all the street-cars of
Washington have been open to colored persons.</p>

<h2><a name="WRONG_AND_UNCONSTITUTIONALITY_OF_FUGITIVE" id="WRONG_AND_UNCONSTITUTIONALITY_OF_FUGITIVE"></a>WRONG AND UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF FUGITIVE
SLAVE ACTS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Report in the Senate of the Committee on Slavery and Freedmen,
February 29, 1864.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 29, 1864, Mr. Sumner reported from the Committee on
Slavery and Freedmen a bill to repeal all acts for the rendition of fugitive
slaves. Accompanying this bill was the following report, of which
ten thousand extra copies were ordered to be printed for the use of the
Senate, together with the views of the minority, by Mr. Buckalew.</p>

<p>The debate on this subject, and the final repeal of all Fugitive Slave
Acts, appear at a later date.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The Select Committee on Slavery and the Treatment of
Freedmen, to whom were referred sundry petitions asking
for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, and also
asking for the repeal of all acts for the rendition of fugitive
slaves, have had the same under consideration, and
ask leave to make the following report.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Two Fugitive Slave Acts still exist unrepealed on
our statute-book. The first, dated as long ago as
1793, was preceded by an official correspondence, supposed
to show necessity for legislation.<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The second,
belonging to the compromises of 1850, was introduced
by a report from Mr. Butler, of South Carolina, at that
time Chairman of the Judiciary Committee of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
Senate.<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> In proposing the repeal of all legislation on the
subject, it seems not improper to imitate the latter precedent
by a report assigning briefly the reasons governing
the Committee.</p>


<h3>RELATION BETWEEN SLAVERY AND THE FUGITIVE
SLAVE ACTS.</h3>

<p>These Acts may be viewed as part of the system of
Slavery, and therefore obnoxious to the judgment which
Civilization is accumulating against this Barbarism; or
they may be viewed as independent agencies. But it is
difficult to consider them in the latter character alone;
for if Slavery be the offence which it doubtless is, then
must it infect all the agencies it employs. Especially
at this moment, when, by common consent, Slavery is
recognized as the origin and life of the Rebellion, must
all its agencies be regarded with more than ordinary
repugnance.</p>

<p>If in time of peace all Fugitive Slave Acts were offensive,
as requiring what humanity and religion both
condemn, they must at this moment be still more offensive,
when Slavery, in whose behalf they were made,
has risen in arms against the National Government. It
is bad enough, at any time, to thrust an escaped slave
back into bondage: it is absurd to thrust him back at
a moment when Slavery is rallying all its forces for the
conflict it has madly challenged. The crime of such a
transaction is not diminished by its absurdity. A slave
with courage and address to escape from his master has
the qualities needed for a soldier of Freedom; but existing
statutes require his arrest and sentence to bondage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>In annulling these statutes, Congress simply withdraws
an irrational support from Slavery. It does nothing
against Slavery, but merely refuses to do anything
for it. In this respect the present proposition differs
from all preceding measures of Abolition, as refusal to
help an offender on the highway differs from an attempt
to take his life.</p>

<p>And yet it cannot be doubted that the withdrawal of
Congressional support must contribute effectively to the
abolition of Slavery: not that, at the present moment,
Congressional support is of any considerable value, but
because its withdrawal would be an encouragement to
that universal public opinion which must soon sweep
this Barbarism from our country. It is one of the felicities
of our present position, that by repealing all acts
for the restitution of slaves we may hasten the happy
day of Freedom and of Peace.</p>

<p>Regarding this question in association with the broader
question of Universal Emancipation, we find that
every sentiment or reason or argument for the latter
pleads for the repeal of these obnoxious statutes, but
that the difficulties sometimes supposed to beset Emancipation
do not touch the proposed repeal, so that we
might well insist upon the latter, even if we hesitated
with regard to the former. The Committee find new
motive to the recommendation they now make, when
they see how important its adoption must be in securing
the extinction of Slavery.</p>

<p>It is not enough to consider the proposed measure in
its relations to Emancipation. Even if Congress be not
ready to make an end of Slavery, it cannot hesitate to
make an end of all Fugitive Slave Acts. Against the
latter there are cumulative arguments of Constitutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Law and of duty, beyond any to be arrayed against
Slavery itself. A man may even support Slavery, and
yet reject the Fugitive Slave Acts.</p>


<h3>THE FUGITIVE CLAUSE IN THE CONSTITUTION, AND
THE RULES FOR ITS INTERPRETATION.</h3>

<p>These Acts profess to be founded upon certain words
of the Constitution. On this account we must consider
these words with a certain degree of care. They are as
follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>No person</i> held to service or labor in one State, under
the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence
of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such
service or labor, but <i>shall be delivered up on claim of the
party to whom such service or labor may be due</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

</div>

<p>John Quincy Adams has already remarked that in
this much debated clause the laws of grammar are violated
in order to assert the claim of property in man;
for the verb “shall be delivered up” has for nominative
“no person,” and thus the grammatical interpretation
actually forbids the rendition. It is on this jumble
and muddle of words that a superstructure of wrong
is built. Even bad grammar may be disregarded, especially
in behalf of human rights; but it is worthy of
remark, that, in this clause of the Constitution, an outrage
on human rights was begun by an outrage on language.</p>

<p>Assuming that the clause is not invalidated by bad
grammar, it is often insisted, and here the Committee
concur, that, according to authoritative rules of interpretation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
it cannot be considered applicable to fugitive
slaves; since, whatever the intention of its authors, no
words were employed positively describing fugitive slaves
<i>and nobody else</i>. Obviously, this clause, on its face, is
applicable to apprentices, and it is known historically
that under it apprentices have been delivered up on the
claim of the party to whom “such service or labor” was
due. It is therefore only by discarding its primary
signification, and adopting a secondary signification, that
it can be made to embrace fugitive slaves. On any
common occasion, not involving a question of human
rights, such secondary signification might be supplied
by intendment; but it cannot be supplied to limit or
deny human rights, especially to defeat Liberty, without
a violation of fundamental rules which constitute
the glory of the law.</p>

<p>This principle is common to every system of civilized
jurisprudence; but it has been nowhere expressed with
more force than in the maxims of the Common Law and
the decisions of its courts. It entered into the remarkable
argument of Granville Sharp, which preceded the
judgment extorted from Lord Mansfield, and led him to
exclaim, in words strictly applicable to the Constitution
of the United States, “The word <i>slaves</i>, or anything that
can justify the enslaving of others, is not to be found,
God be thanked,” in the British Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> It entered
into the judgment pronounced at last by Lord
Mansfield, under the benevolent pressure of Granville
Sharp, in the renowned Somerset case, where this great
magistrate grandly declared that Slavery could not exist
in England. His words cannot be too often quoted
as an illustration of the true rule of interpretation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span> “The
state of Slavery,” he said, “is of such a nature, that it is
incapable of being introduced on any reasons moral or
political, <i>but only by positive law</i>.… It is so odious,
that nothing can be suffered to support it <i>but positive
law</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> Therefore the authority for Slavery cannot be
derived from any words of doubtful import. Such words
are not “positive.” And clearly, by the same rule, <i>if the
words are susceptible of two different significations, that
must be adopted which is hostile to Slavery</i>. This same
cardinal principle, thus announced by the Chief Justice
of England, has been echoed by the Chief Justice of the
United States, being none other than Marshall, speaking
for our own Supreme Court, when he said, “<i>Where
rights are infringed</i>, … the legislative intention must
be expressed with <i>irresistible clearness</i> to induce a court
of justice to suppose a design to effect such objects.”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
In a clause capable of <i>two meanings</i> there can be no
such “irresistible clearness” as would justify an infringement
of human rights.</p>

<p>But Lord Mansfield and Chief Justice Marshall were
simply giving practical application to those venerable
maxims cherished in America as in England. It is not
necessary to repeat them at length. They are substantially
embodied in the words, <i>Angliæ jura in omni casu
Libertati dant favorem</i>,&mdash;“The Laws of England, <i>in every
case</i>, show favor to Liberty”; and also in those other vigorous
words of Fortescue, <i>Impius et crudelis judicandus
est qui Libertati non favet</i>,&mdash;“He is to be adjudged impious
and cruel who does not favor Liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> By such
lessons have all who administer justice been warned for
centuries against the sacrifice of human rights. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
Blackstone, whose personal sympathies were with power,
was led to declare, in most suggestive words, worthy of
a commentator on English Law, that “the law is always
ready to catch at anything in favor of Liberty.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
And Hallam, whose instincts were always for Freedom,
has adopted and vindicated this rule of interpretation
as a pole-star of Constitutional Liberty. “It was,” says
this great author, “by dwelling on all authorities in
favor of Liberty, <i>and by setting aside those which made
against it</i>, that our ancestors overthrew the claims of
unbounded prerogative.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Nor can it be doubted that
this conduct helped to build those great English safeguards
of Freedom which have been an example to
mankind.</p>

<p>This rule has never received plainer illustration than
in the writings of Dr. Webster, the eminent lexicographer.
In a tract bearing date 1795, long before
the heats engendered by the Fugitive Slave Act, he
used language which, if applied to our Constitution,
must defeat every interpretation favorable to Slavery.
“Where there are two constructions,” he says, “the one
favorable, the other odious, <i>that which is odious is always
to be rejected</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> This principle, thus sententiously
expressed by the American lexicographer, may be found
also in the judgments of courts and the writings of civilians
without number. It is one of the commonplaces
of interpretation. Lord Coke, our master in English
law, tells us, that, where words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span> “may have a double intendment,
and the one standeth with law and right, and
the other is wrongful and against law, the intendment
that standeth with law shall be taken.”<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> And Vattel,
a master in International Law, says that “we should
particularly regard the famous distinction of things <i>favorable</i>
and things <i>odious</i>,” and then he assumes that
we must “consider as <i>odious</i> everything that in its
own nature is rather hurtful than of use to the human
race.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> But the clause of the Constitution which has
been made the apology of the Fugitive Slave Act is
clearly open to “two constructions,” according to the
language of Dr. Webster, or “a double intendment,”
according to the language of Lord Coke, or one “favorable”
and the other “odious,” according to Vattel. Thus
far in our history, under the malignant influence of
Slavery, the odious construction or intendment has prevailed.</p>

<p>There is also another voice to be heard in determining
the meaning of a doubtful clause. It is the Preamble,
which, on the threshold, proclaims the spirit in
which the Constitution was framed, and furnishes a rule
of interpretation. To “<i>establish justice</i>, insure domestic
tranquillity, provide for the common defence, <i>promote
the general welfare, and secure the blessings of Liberty</i> to
ourselves and our posterity”: such are the declared objects
of the Constitution, which must be kept present
to the mind as we read its various provisions. And
every word must be so interpreted as best to uphold
these objects. The Preamble would be powerless against
any “positive” sanction of Slavery by unequivocal words;
but, on the other hand, any attempted sanction of Slavery
by words not “positive” and not unequivocal, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
be powerless against the Preamble, which, in this respect,
is in harmony with the ancient maxims of the
law.</p>


<h3>ANALYSIS OF THE WORDS OF THE FUGITIVE CLAUSE.</h3>

<p>Looking more minutely at the precise words of this
clause, we see how completely it is stamped with equivocation
from beginning to end. <i>Every descriptive word
it contains is double in signification.</i> The clause may be
seen, first, in what it does not contain; and, secondly,
in what it does contain. It does not contain the word
“slave” or “slavery,” which singly and exclusively denotes
the idea of property in man. Had either of these
fatal words been employed, there would have been no
uncertainty or duplicity. But in abandoning these
words, all idea of property in man was abandoned also.
Other words were adopted, simply because they might
mean something else, and therefore would not render
the Constitution on its face “odious.” But the unquestionable
fact that these words might mean something
else makes it impossible for them to mean “slave” or
“slavery,” unless in this behalf we set aside the most
commanding rules of interpretation. It is clear that
the authors of this clause attempted an impossibility.
They wished to secure Slavery without plainly saying
so; but such is Slavery that it cannot be secured without
plainly saying so. Naturally and inevitably they
failed, as if they had attempted to describe <i>black</i> by
words which might mean <i>white</i>, or to authorize crime
by words which naturally mean something that is not
crime. The thing could not be done. The attempt to
square the circle is not more absurd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<p>The clause begins with the descriptive words, “No
<i>person</i> held to service or labor in one State under the
laws thereof.” Now a slave is not a “person,” with the
rights of persons, but a <i>chattel</i> or <i>thing</i>. Such is the received
definition of the Slave States, handed down from
Aristotle. He is not “held to service or labor,” but he
is held as property. The terms employed describe an
apprentice, but not a slave. And he must be held “under
the laws” of a State. Here again is the case of an
apprentice, who is clearly held “under the laws” of a
State. But we have the authority of Mr. Mason, recently
of the Senate from Virginia, for saying that no
proof can be produced that Slavery in any State “is
established by <i>existing laws</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The person thus described
shall not “be <i>discharged</i> from such service or
labor.” Clearly an apprentice is discharged, but a slave
is manumitted or emancipated. This undischarged person
“shall be delivered up on <i>claim</i> of the party to whom
such service or labor may be <i>due</i>.” But all these words
imply <i>contract</i>, or at least <i>debt</i>, as in the case of an apprentice.
The slave can <i>owe</i> no “service or labor” to
his master. There is nothing in their relations out of
which any such obligation can spring. The whole condition
stands on force and nothing else. It is robbery tempered
by the lash,&mdash;not merely robbery of all the fruits
of industry, but robbery of wife and child. To such
terrible assumption the language of <i>contract</i> or <i>debt</i> is
totally inapplicable. Nothing can be “due” from slave
to master, unless it be that “resistance to tyrants” which
is “obedience to God.” It is absurd to say that “labor or
service,” in any sense, whether of justice or of law, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
be “due” from the slave. The same power which takes
wife and child may exact this further sacrifice, but not
because it is “due.”</p>

<p>Such is the simple truth touching this much debated
clause. At the touchstone of unquestioned rules of interpretation
its <i>odious</i> character disappears, and astonishment
prevails that the public mind for so long a
period could have been perverted with regard to its
true meaning. Nobody can doubt that this clause <i>may</i>
be interpreted in favor of Freedom, so as to exclude all
idea of property in man. But if it <i>may</i>, then such is
the voice of Freedom that it <i>must</i>.</p>


<h3>APPLICABLE TO INDENTED SERVANTS.</h3>

<p>Here it is important to consider, that, besides apprentices,
there was a class of “indented servants” embraced
by this clause. From Bancroft we learn that this species
of servitude, under indentures or covenants, had
from the first existed in Virginia. According to the
historian, “the servant stood to his master in the relation
of a <i>debtor</i>,” which, be it observed, is not the condition
of a slave. From the same authority we learn
that “the supply of white servants became a regular
business,”&mdash;that, “like negroes, they were to be purchased
on shipboard, as men buy horses at a fair,”&mdash;that
“in 1672 the average price in the Colonies, where
five years of service were due, was about ten pounds,
while a negro was worth twenty or twenty-five pounds.”<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
The Scots captured on the field of Dunbar, royalist prisoners
of the Battle of Worcester, and companions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Monmouth in his ill-starred insurrection were sent to
the Colonies as a merchantable commodity, and there
held in slavery for life or for years.</p>

<p>The other historian of our country, Hildreth, contributes
to our knowledge of this class of servants. According
to him, the importation of indented white persons,
called “servants,” or sometimes “redemptioners,”
in contradistinction to negroes, known as slaves, was
extensively carried on as late as 1750, especially in
the Middle States; and he mentions, that the Colonial
enactments for keeping them in order, and especially
for preventing their escape, were often very harsh and
severe. They were put, for the most part, on a level
with slaves, but their case in other respects was different.
Except in very young persons, the term of service
seldom or never exceeded seven years, and in all cases
it was limited by law.<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> Even during the Revolution
these indented servants appear on the stage. Many
were enlisted in the army, and, yielding to the earnest
request of Washington, Congress relinquished a plan
already adopted of stopping a portion of their pay for
the benefit of their masters.<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>An English Colonial official, Eddis, in a letter from
America, dated September 20, 1770, describes four different
denominations of persons “in a state of servitude”:
first, the “negroes,” who are the entire property
of their respective owners; secondly, “convicts,” transported
from the mother country for a limited term;
“indented servants,” engaged for five years previous
to leaving England; and “free-willers,” supposed from
their situation to possess superior advantages. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
he proceeds to describe. Of the last class he says,
they are received under express condition, that, on
arrival in America, they are to be allowed a number
of days to dispose of themselves most to their advantage,
but, in fact, they are rarely permitted to set foot
on shore until they have bound themselves.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>If, happily, at the formation of the Constitution, these
servants had diminished in number, or had ceased to
exist as a class, the condition was not unknown. They
were persons “held to service or labor,” and the provision
of the Constitution was strictly applicable to them.</p>

<p>Rejecting the odious application involving the support
of Slavery, we follow received rules and the undoubted
genius of the Common Law. How anxiously
judges seek to evade an obnoxious penal statute is illustrated
by a curious case mentioned by Lord Campbell.
It was proved that the defendant, being in a stubble-field
with a pointer, fired his gun at a covey of partridges,
and shot two, when the judge, disliking to enforce the
Game Laws, objected that there was no evidence that
the gun was loaded with shot, and advised the jury to
conclude that the birds fell dead from fright.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> But a
clause for the rendition of fugitive slaves is entitled to
as little respect as the Game Laws, and, when the words
employed are applicable to others than slaves, they should
not be applied to slaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>


<h3>NO LAPSE OF TIME CAN DEFEAT AN INTERPRETATION
IN FAVOR OF LIBERTY.</h3>

<p>Against this interpretation, so overpowering in reason
and authority, it is no objection that thus far Slavery
has prevailed. There is no statute of limitation and
no prescription against the undying claims of Liberty.
Rejected or neglected in one generation, they revive in
another; nor can they be impaired by any desuetude.
This objection was impotent to prevent Lord Mansfield
from declaring that Slavery could not exist in England,
although practically, under a false interpretation of the
British Constitution, sustained by the professional opinions
of Talbot and Yorke, and by the judgment of the
latter on the bench, under the name of Lord Hardwicke,
African slaves were sold in the streets of London, and
advertised for sale in English papers, for a period full as
long as that which has witnessed the false interpretation
of our Constitution. As length of time did not prevail
against a true interpretation of the British Constitution
in the case of Somerset, it ought not to prevail against
a true interpretation of our Constitution now.</p>

<p>There is no chemistry in time to transmute wrong
into right. Therefore the whole question on the Constitution
is still open, as on the day of its adoption.
The cases of misinterpretation are of no value,&mdash;at least
they cannot settle the question against Liberty. Such
was the noble declaration of Charles James Fox in the
British Parliament, when, in words strictly pertinent
now, he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> “Wherever any usage appeared subversive
of the Constitution, if it had lasted for one or for
two hundred years, <i>it was not a precedent, but an
usurpation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> And such is the character of every instance in
which our Constitution has been perverted to sanction
Slavery.</p>


<h3>PERVERSIONS WITH REGARD TO ORIGIN OF THE FUGITIVE
CLAUSE.</h3>

<p>A slight examination will show prevailing perversions
with regard to the origin and history of this
clause. Not content with imparting to it a meaning
which it cannot bear, the partisans of Slavery have
given to this clause an origin and history having no
foundation in truth.</p>

<p>It is common to assert that the clause was intended
to remove or counteract some difficulty which had occurred
anterior to the Convention. But there is no
evidence of any such difficulty. There was no complaint.
Not a single voice was raised in advance to
ask any such security.</p>

<p>It is also asserted, with peculiar confidence, that this
clause, interpreted to require the rendition of fugitive
slaves, constituted one of the original compromises of
the Constitution, without which the Union could not
have been formed. This pretension makes an asserted
stipulation for the rendition of fugitive slaves one of the
corner-stones of the Union. To this discreditable imputation
upon the fathers of the Republic the Supreme
Court seems to have lent sanction, when it declared, in
the famous Prigg case, not only that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span> “the object of this
clause was to secure to the citizens of the slaveholding
States the complete right and title of ownership in their
slaves <i>as property</i> in every State in the Union into which
they might escape,” but that “the full recognition of
this right and title … was so vital to the preservation
of their domestic interests and institutions, that it
cannot be doubted <i>that it constituted a fundamental article,
without the adoption of which the Union could not
have been formed</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> Mark the way in which this extraordinary
statement is ushered in,&mdash;“It cannot be doubted”!
But it is doubted, and more too. Chief Justice
Taney, at a later day, put forth the statement, that, during
the Revolution, it was an accepted truth that colored
men “had no rights which the white man was
bound to respect,”<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a>&mdash;and this statement was said to
stand on authentic history; but it is now exploded, and
the other statement must share the same fate. A careful
inquiry shows that it is utterly without support in
the records of the Convention, where the real compromises
are revealed; nor is there a single contemporary
pamphlet, speech, article, or published letter, out of which
any such thing can be inferred. Surely, had this provision
been of such controlling importance, it could not
have escaped notice, at least, in the “Federalist,” when
its writers undertook to describe and group the powers
of Congress “which provide for the harmony and proper
intercourse among the States”;<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> but the “Federalist”
is entirely silent with regard to it. And yet we are
gravely told “it cannot be doubted” that this provision
“constituted a fundamental article, without the adoption
of which the Union could not have been formed.”
Frequent repetition has caused the common belief that
this was history, instead of fable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p>

<p>The actual compromises of the Constitution are well
known. They were three in number. One established
the equality of all the States in the Union, by securing
equal representation in the Senate for the small States
and large States. Another allowed representatives to
the Slave States according to the whole number of free
persons and “three fifths of all other persons,” in consideration
that direct taxes should be apportioned in the
same way. Another was the toleration of the slave-trade
for twenty years, in consideration of commercial
concessions to the “Eastern members.” Such are the
actual compromises of the Constitution, with regard to
which there is evidence. But imagination or falsehood
is the only authority for adding the rendition of fugitive
slaves to this list.</p>


<h3>TRUE ORIGIN OF THE FUGITIVE CLAUSE.</h3>

<p>The debates of the Convention attest the little contemporary
interest in this clause. In all the general
propositions or plans successively brought forward, from
the meeting on the 25th of May, 1787, there was no allusion
to fugitive slaves; nor was there any allusion to
them, even in debate, till as late as the 28th of August,
when, as the Convention was drawing to a close, they
were incidentally mentioned in a discussion on another
subject. The question was on the article providing for
the privileges of citizens in different States. Here is
the authentic report by Mr. Madison of what was said.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“General [Charles Cotesworth] Pinckney was not satisfied
with it. <i>He seemed to wish some provision should be included
in favor of property in slaves.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>

<p>But he made no proposition. Mark the modesty of
the suggestion. Here was no offer of compromise,&mdash;not
even a complaint, much less a suggestion of corner-stone.
The next article under discussion provided for
the surrender of fugitives from justice. Mr. Butler and
Mr. Charles Pinckney, both from South Carolina, now
moved openly, but without any offer of compromise, to
require “fugitive slaves and servants to be delivered up
like criminals.” But the very boldness of the proposition
drew attention and aroused opposition. Mr. Wilson,
of Pennsylvania, afterwards the eminent judge and
lecturer on Law, promptly remarked: “This would oblige
the executive of the State to do it, <i>at the public expense</i>.”
Mr. Sherman, of Connecticut, followed in apt words, saying
that he “saw no more propriety in the public seizing
and surrendering a slave or servant than a horse.”
Under this proper pressure the offensive proposition
was withdrawn. The article for the surrender of criminals
was then adopted. On the next day, August 29th,
Mr. Butler showed that the lovers of Liberty had not
spoken in vain. Abandoning the idea of any proposition
openly requiring the surrender of fugitive slaves,
he moved an <i>equivocal</i> clause, substantially like that
now found in the Constitution, which, without debate
or opposition of any kind, was unanimously adopted,&mdash;or,
according to the report of Mr. Madison, <i>nem. con.</i><a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a>
What could not be done directly was attempted indirectly;
and the partisans of Slavery contented themselves,
according to the teachings of old Polonius, with
language which only “by indirections finds directions
out.” But no “indirection” can find Slavery out. The
language which sanctions such a wrong must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> “direct.”
Therefore, at the moment of seeming triumph,
the partisans of Slavery failed.</p>

<p>Such is the indubitable origin of a clause latterly declared
a compromise of the Constitution and a corner-stone
of the Republic. That a clause for the hunting
of slaves was recognized at the time as compromise or
corner-stone is an absurdity disowned alike by history
and by reason. That the clause was adopted, <i>nem. con.</i>,
with the idea, that, <i>according to any received rules of interpretation</i>,
it could authorize the hunting of slaves,
it is difficult to believe. The very statement that it
was adopted <i>nem. con.</i> shows that it must have been
regarded, <i>according to received rules of interpretation</i>,
as having no “positive” character; for there were eminent
members of the Convention whose declared opinions
must have prevented them from consenting to any
such proposition, if it were supposed for a moment to
turn the Republic which they were then organizing into
a mighty Slave-Hunter. There sat Gouverneur Morris,
who only a short time before exclaimed in the Convention:
“<i>He never would concur in upholding domestic Slavery.</i>
It was a nefarious institution. It was the curse
of Heaven on the States where it prevailed.”<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> There
sat Oliver Ellsworth, afterwards Chief Justice, who said,
in words which strike at all support of Slavery by the
National Government: “The morality or wisdom of
Slavery are considerations belonging to the States themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
There sat Elbridge Gerry, afterwards Vice-President,
who openly declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> “we had nothing
to do with the conduct of the States as to slaves, <i>but
ought to be careful not to give any sanction to it</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> There
sat Roger Sherman, who avowed that he was “opposed
to a tax on slaves imported, as making the matter
worse, <i>because it implied they were property</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> And,
greatest of all, there sat Benjamin Franklin, who, by
character and conviction, in every fibre of his moral
and intellectual being, was pledged against any sanction
of Slavery. Who can suppose that these wise and
illustrious patriarchs of Liberty all consented, <i>nem. con.</i>,
not only to sanction Slavery and to recognize property
in man, but to put a kennel of bloodhounds into the
Constitution, ready to hunt the flying bondman? They
did no such thing; or, if it is insisted, <i>contrary to received
rules of interpretation</i>, that such must be the signification
of their language, clearly they did not understand
it so. Doubtless there were members of the
Convention who, in passion for Slavery, cheered themselves
with the delusion that they had adequately described,
in “positive” terms, the pretension they hoped
to embody in the Constitution; but the <i>legal meaning</i> of
this provision must be determined, not by the passion
of such members, but by the actual language employed,
according to received rules of interpretation, from which
there is no appeal. Other rules may be set aside as
inapplicable; but the rule, which, in presence of any
doubtful phrase, any indirect language, or any word capable
of a double sense, requires that the interpretation
shall be <i>in favor of Liberty</i>, is the most commanding of
all.</p>

<p>Thus, when this clause took its place in the Constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
<i>nem. con.</i>, it was clearly a cipher. It meant nothing,
or at least nothing “odious.” This conclusion becomes
still more apparent in the light of two special
incidents, which cannot be forgotten in determining the
validity of any claim for Slavery under equivocal words.
The first is the saying of Mr. Madison, which he has
recorded in the report of the Convention, that it was
“wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea that there
could be property in men.”<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Admirable words, constituting
a binding rule of interpretation. And yet, in the
face of this declaration, it is insisted that the “idea that
there could be property in men” is embodied in the
double-faced words of the fugitive clause. But as the
words are susceptible of two meanings, clearly they
should be interpreted so as to exclude what is “wrong.”
The other incident furnishes the same lesson in a manner
more pointed still. It appears that on the 13th of
September, 1787, a fortnight after the fugitive clause
was adopted in its earliest form, and while the Convention
was considering the report of its committee on
style and arrangement, “On motion of Mr. Randolph,
the word ‘<i>servitude</i>’ was struck out and ‘<i>service</i>’ unanimously
inserted, the former being thought to express
the condition of slaves, <i>and the latter the obligations of
free persons</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> Thus the word “service” ceases even
to be equivocal, for it was unanimously adopted as expressing
“the obligations of free persons.” And such it
would have continued to express always, if Slavery had
not unhappily triumphed over the National Government
in all departments, executive, legislative, and judicial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not doubted that at home in the Slave States
the fugitive clause was interpreted as embracing slaves,
and that this asserted license was at times mentioned as
a reason for the adoption of the Constitution. Even Mr.
Madison, who had declared in the National Convention
that it was “wrong to admit in the Constitution the idea
that there could be property in men,” argued afterwards,
in the Virginia Convention, that “this clause was expressly
inserted to enable owners of slaves to reclaim
them,”<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>&mdash;all of which was doubtless true, but the question
still occurs as to the constitutional efficacy of the
clause. Mr. Iredell, who was not a member of the National
Convention, undertook, in the North Carolina Convention,
to explain what it had done. Announcing that the
clause was intended to include slaves, he added: “The
Northern delegates, <i>owing to their particular scruples</i> on
the subject of Slavery, did not choose the word <i>slave</i> to
be mentioned,”<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>&mdash;so that, on the very statement of this
expositor, the question naturally arose whether slaves
were really included. In the South Carolina Convention,
General Pinckney, who in the National Convention
first started the idea of “some provision in favor of property
in slaves,” boasted that this had been obtained; but
he added, in suggestive words, “We have made the best
terms for the security of this species of property it was
in our power to make. <i>We would have made better, if
we could.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> True enough. The Slave-Masters got all
they could: if possible, they would have got more.
But the question still recurs, whether in this equivocal
provision they got anything. In the National Convention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
they adopted a clause which was only another illustration
of “Mr. Facing-both-ways.” At home, in
their local conventions, they courageously insisted that it
faced only one way. Without dwelling on old sayings
about “a villain outwitting himself,” and wit failing
when “upon an ill employ,” clearly the wit of the Slave-Masters
was “upon an ill employ” when it sought to
foist Slavery into the text of the Constitution; and it
is easy to see that all who engaged in the work were
like “a villain outwitting himself.” Whatever they may
have thought or boasted, the thing was not done.</p>

<p>From the origin of the fugitive clause, and the circumstances
attending its adoption, it is apparent that
it has been the occasion of infinite exaggeration and
misrepresentation. Like a Pagan idol, it has been
worshipped and covered with gifts; but the prevailing
superstition which sustained the imposture has at last
disappeared, and we see nothing but a vulgar image of
painted wood.</p>


<h3>LEGISLATION FOR RENDITION OF FUGITIVE SLAVES.</h3>

<p>From the clause in the Constitution, the Committee
pass to a consideration of the legislation founded upon
it. Of course, if the clause is misunderstood, no legislation
can derive any validity from it. <i>Nothing can
come out of nothing</i>; and since there is nothing in the
Constitution positively requiring rendition of fugitive
slaves by the National Government, there can be no
authority for any legislation by Congress on the subject.
Therefore the argument against the existing statutes
is complete. But, since it is proposed to reverse
an early policy of the Government, the Committee are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
unwilling to stop here. These statutes must be considered
in their history and character.</p>

<p>As early as 1793, while Congress was sitting in Philadelphia,
provisions for the surrender of fugitive slaves
were fastened upon a bill for the surrender of fugitives
from justice, and the whole was adopted, apparently
with little consideration. Thus, accidentally, Congress
assumed the <i>odious</i> power to organize slave-hunting.
But the Act was scarcely passed, before the conscience
of people, not only at the North, but even in Maryland,
began to be aroused. Granville Sharp, who in England
so bravely maintained the national cause as well as the
cause of the slave, addressed a letter to the “Maryland
Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the
Relief of Free Negroes and others unlawfully held in
Bondage,” where he set forth elaborately those binding
rules of interpretation, which, according to English law,
require a court to incline always in favor of Liberty.
This letter purports to have been published, as a pamphlet,
by order of the Society, and to have been printed
at “Baltimore, in Calvert Street, near the Court-House,
by D. Graham, L. Yundt, and W. Patton,” in 1793. In
a brief preface, the Maryland Society thus reveals the
trials attending the new Fugitive Slave Act:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Still Slavery exists, and, <i>in the case of slaves escaping
from their masters</i>, the friends of Universal Liberty are often
embarrassed in their conduct by a conflict between their
principles and <i>the obligations imposed by unwise and perhaps
unconstitutional laws</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Such is a contemporary record of sensibilities in a
Slave State; and let it be mentioned to the honor of
Maryland. But it is reasonable to suppose that sensibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
in States further north were touched still more.
Mr. Quincy, whose living memory embraces this early
period, reports, that, when an enforcement of this Act
was attempted in Boston, the crowd thronging the room
of the magistrate quietly and spontaneously opened a
lane for the fugitive, who was thus enabled to save himself
from Slavery, and also save the country from the
dishonor of such a sacrifice. Almost at the same time,
in patriotic Vermont, a judge of the Supreme Court of
the State, on application for the surrender of an alleged
slave, accompanied by documentary evidence, refused to
comply, <i>unless the master could show a bill of sale from
the Almighty</i>. Such was the popular feeling which this
earlier legislation encountered.</p>

<p>There is authentic evidence that this popular feeling
was recognized by President Washington as a proper
guide, where he was personally interested. A slave of
Mrs. Washington had escaped to New Hampshire. The
President, in an autograph letter, which has been produced
in the Senate,<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> addressed to Mr. Whipple, the
collector at Portsmouth, and dated at Philadelphia, November
28, 1796, after expressing the desire of “her
mistress” for the return of the slave, lays down the
following rule of conduct:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not mean, however, by this request, that <i>such violent
measures</i> should be used as <i>would excite</i> a mob or riot,
which might be the case, if she has adherents, <i>or even uneasy
sensations in the minds of well-disposed citizens</i>. Rather than
either of these should happen, I would forego her services
altogether,&mdash;and the example, also, which is of infinite more
importance.”</p>

</div>

<p>The fugitive never was returned, but survived to a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
old age, down to a recent period,&mdash;a living witness to
that public opinion which made even the mildest of Fugitive
Slave Acts a dead letter.</p>

<p>At last, in 1850, after the subject of Slavery had been
agitated in Congress without interruption for nearly
twenty years, a series of propositions was adopted, and
solemnly declared to be <i>compromises</i>, by which all the
questions concerning Slavery were permanently settled,
so as never again to vex the country,&mdash;as if any question
could be permanently settled except on principles
of justice. But the “gruel” was made, and among its
ingredients “for a charm of powerful trouble” was a
new Fugitive Slave Act, first reported from the Committee
on the Judiciary by Mr. Butler, of South Carolina,
but afterwards amended by a substitute from Mr.
Mason, of Virginia, so as to become substantially his
measure. It is needless to mention its details. Suffice
it to say, that in these, as in general conception, it was
harsh, cruel, and vindictive. Few statutes in history
have been so utterly inhuman, not excepting even those
British statutes for the oppression of the Irish Catholics,
which are pictured by Edmund Burke in words strictly
applicable to the monstrosity of our country:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That truly barbarous system, where almost all the parts
were outrages on the rights of humanity and the laws of Nature,”&mdash;“a
machine of wise and elaborate contrivance, and
as well fitted for the oppression, impoverishment, and degradation
of a people, and the debasement in them of human
nature itself, as ever proceeded from the perverted ingenuity
of man.”<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, unquestionably, was the Fugitive Slave Act of
1850, which is still allowed to remain on the statute-book,
a blot upon our country and age.</p>

<p>Where a measure is so plainly repugnant to reason
and authority, and on its face has so little foundation in
the Constitution, any elaborate argument seems superfluous,
especially at this moment, when Slavery everywhere
is yielding to Freedom. The general conscience
condemns the inhuman statute, and this is enough.</p>

<p>But it is important to show how the country has been
deceived. Therefore, briefly, the Committee call attention
to the constitutional objections.</p>


<h3>UNCONSTITUTIONAL USURPATION OF POWER BY CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>Forgetting, then, for the moment, the Preamble of
the Constitution, which speaks always for Justice and
Liberty,&mdash;forgetting, also, the venerable maxim of the
law, that “we must incline always in favor of Freedom,”
and likewise that other maxim, that “he is impious and
cruel who does not favor Freedom,”&mdash;refusing, according
to the requirement of law, “to catch at anything
in favor of Liberty,” and, in spite of all received rules of
interpretation, assuming that the words of the fugitive
clause adequately define fugitive slaves,&mdash;the question
then arises, if this clause, thus defiantly interpreted, confers
any power upon Congress.</p>

<p>Clearly not.</p>

<p>Search the Constitution, and you will find no grant,
general or special, conferring upon Congress power to
legislate with regard to fugitives from service or labor.
In the general catalogue of powers this is not mentioned;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
nor does it appear in any special grant. There is nothing
in the clause itself, there is nothing in any other
clause, applicable to this pretended power. The whole
subject is left to stand on a clause which, whatever its
meaning otherwise, plainly on its face is only a <i>compact</i>,
and not a grant of power. And in this respect it differs
on its face from other provisions of the Constitution.
For instance, Congress is expressly empowered “<i>to establish
an uniform rule</i> of naturalization, and <i>uniform
laws</i> on the subject of bankruptcies, <i>throughout the
United States</i>.” Without this grant, these two important
subjects would have fallen within the control of the
States, the nation having no power <i>to establish a uniform
rule</i> thereupon. Now, instead of the existing compact
on fugitives from service or labor, it would have been
easy, had any such desire prevailed, to add this case
to the provision on naturalization and bankruptcy, and
empowered Congress <i>to establish a uniform rule for the
surrender of fugitives from service or labor throughout the
United States</i>. Then would Congress have had unquestionable
jurisdiction. But nobody in the Convention,
not one of the hardiest partisans of Slavery, presumed
to make this proposition. Had it been made, it is easy
to see that it must have been most unceremoniously
dismissed.</p>

<p>The genius of the Common Law, to which our ancestors
were devoted, cried out against any such concession.
If we refer to its great master, Lord Coke, from
whose teachings in that day there was no appeal, we
find its living voice. In the Third Institute he thus
expresses himself:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span> “It is holden, and so it hath been
resolved, <i>that divided kingdoms, under several kings in
league one with another, are sanctuaries for servants</i> or
subjects flying for safety from one kingdom to another,
and, upon demand made by them, are not, <i>by the laws
and liberties of kingdoms</i>, to be delivered.”<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> Unquestionably,
if such “sanctuaries” may be overturned, it can
be only in a manner consistent with “laws and liberties”
of the States where the fugitive is found, and not
through the exercise of a domineering prerogative by
Congress.</p>

<p>Whatever the real meaning of the clause in other respects,
plainly it is a <i>compact</i>, with a <i>prohibition</i> on the
States, <i>conferring no power on the nation</i>. In natural
signification it is a compact. According to examples
of other countries and principles of jurisprudence, it is
a compact. All arrangements for surrender of fugitives
are customarily compacts. Except under express obligations
of treaty, no nation is bound to surrender fugitives.
Especially has this been the case with fugitives
for Freedom. Bodin asserted the freedom of all foreign
slaves just so soon as they crossed into France.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> In
mediæval Europe cities set up the same immunity, even
against claimants under the same national government.
In 1531, while the Netherlands and Spain were united
under Charles the Fifth, the supreme council of Mechlin
rejected an application from Spain for the surrender of
a fugitive slave. By express compact alone could this
be secured. But the provision of the Constitution was
borrowed from the Ordinance of the Northwestern Territory,
which is expressly declared to be a “compact,”<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and
this Ordinance, finally drawn by Nathan Dane, of Massachusetts,
was again borrowed, in some of its distinctive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
features, from the early institutions of Massachusetts,
among which, as far back as 1643, was a compact of like
nature with other New England States. Thus this provision
is a compact in language, a compact in nature,
and a compact in its whole history; as we have already
seen, it is a compact according to the intentions of our
fathers and the genius of our institutions.</p>

<p>There are two instances in history of compacts which
illustrate the present words. The first is found in a
treaty of peace between Leo the Sixth, Greek Emperor
of Constantinople, and Oleg, Regent of Russia, in the
year of the Christian era 906, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If a Russian slave take flight, or even if he is carried
away under pretence of having been bought, his master can
pursue him and take him wherever he shall find him, and
any man who shall oppose him in his search <i>shall be deemed
guilty</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This compact, made in the unequivocal language of a
barbarous age, has long since ceased to exist; and now,
in our own day, Russia disdains to own a slave.</p>

<p>The other instance is the compact between the New
England colonies in 1643, being one of the “Articles of
Confederation between the Plantations under the Government
of the Massachusetts, the Plantations under the
Government of New Plymouth, the Plantations under
the Government of Connecticut and the Government of
New Haven, with the Plantations in combination therewith.”
Here it is:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>It is also agreed</i>, That, if any servant run away from his
master into any other of these confederated jurisdictions,
that in such case, upon the certificate of one magistrate in
the jurisdiction out of which the said servant fled, or upon
other due proof, the said servant <i>shall be delivered</i> either to
his master or any other that pursues and brings such certificate
or proof.”<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here, by words of <i>agreement</i>, less frank and unequivocal
than those of the earlier time, fugitives are restored.
But this compact, like its Russian prototype, long since
ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the fugitive clause of the Constitution,
whether applicable to fugitive slaves or not, was
never intended to confer power upon Congress, but was
simply a <i>compact</i>, to receive such interpretation as the
States where it was enforced might choose to adopt.</p>


<h3>AUTHORITIES AGAINST THE POWER OF CONGRESS.</h3>

<p>The Committee do not leave this conclusion to rest
merely on unanswerable reason. Authorities add to the
testimony.</p>

<p>Here is the judgment of Chancellor Walworth, of New
York, pronounced in 1835, before this subject had become
the occasion of political strife. The testimony of
the learned Chancellor is the more important, when it is
considered that he has always acted politically with the
Democracy, which has been the support of Slavery.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have looked in vain among the powers delegated to
Congress by the Constitution for any general authority to
that body to legislate on this subject. It certainly is not
contained in any express grant of power, and it does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>appear to be embraced in the general grant of incidental
powers contained in the last clause of the Constitution relative
to the powers of Congress. The law of the United States
respecting fugitives from justice and fugitive slaves is not a
law to carry into effect any of the powers expressly granted
to Congress, ‘or any other power vested by the Constitution
in the Government of the United States, or any department
or officer thereof.’”<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here, also, is the judgment of Chief Justice Hornblower,
of New Jersey, pronounced in 1836. Having
shown that the clause in question confers no power on
Congress, he proceeds as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In short, if the power of legislation upon this subject is
not given to Congress in the second section of the fourth
article of the Constitution, it cannot, I think, be found in that
instrument. The last clause of the eighth section of the
first article gives to Congress a right to make all laws which
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution <i>all
the powers</i> vested by the Constitution in the Government
of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.
But the provisions of the second section of the fourth
article of the Constitution cover no grant to, confide no
trust, and vest <i>no powers</i> in, the Government of the United
States. The language of the whole of that section is to establish
certain principles and rules of action by which the
contracting parties are to be governed in certain specified
cases. The stipulations respecting the rights of citizenship,
and the delivery of persons fleeing from justice or escaping
from bondage, <i>are not grants of power</i> to the General Government,
to be executed by it in derogation of State authority,
but they are in the nature of treaty stipulations, resting for
their fulfilment upon the enlightened patriotism and good
faith of the several States. The argument in favor of Congressional
legislation, founded on the suggestion that some
of the States might refuse a compliance with these constitutional
provisions, or neglect to pass any laws to carry them
into effect, <i>is entitled to no weight</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Afterwards, in a published letter of 1852, the Chief
Justice says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Be assured, my dear Sir, my judgment, whatever it may
be worth, has been for years, and now is, in perfect accordance
with yours in relation to the unconstitutionality of the
Fugitive Slave Laws of 1793 and 1850.”<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Other judicial opinions might be adduced; but, as
they have been pronounced since controversy on this
question, they would be less regarded.</p>

<p>There are opinions, pronounced in the Senate, which,
from the characters of their authors, are entitled to peculiar
consideration.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Mr. Webster gave his
support to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850; but, whatever
may have been his vote, so far as his personal authority
could go, <i>he condemned the Act as unconstitutional</i>.
Here is his opinion, in the famous speech of the 7th
March, 1850.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have always thought that the Constitution addressed
itself to the Legislatures of the States, or to the States
themselves. It says that those persons escaping to other
States ‘shall be delivered up,’ and I confess I have always
been of the opinion that it was an injunction upon the
States themselves. When it is said that a person escaping
into another State, and coming, therefore, within the jurisdiction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>of that State, shall be delivered up, <i>it seems to me the
import of the clause is, that the State itself, in obedience to the
Constitution, shall cause him to be delivered up</i>. <i>That is my
judgment. I have always entertained that opinion, and I entertain
it now.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">“I have always entertained that opinion, and I entertain
it now.” Such are the emphatic words by which
Mr. Webster declares his judgment of the unconstitutionality
of this Act.</p>

<p>He was not alone. Mr. Mason, the actual author of
the Act of Congress, exposed its unconstitutionality in
the very speech by which he introduced it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In my reading of these clauses of the Constitution for
extradition of fugitives of both classes, <i>I advance the confident
opinion</i> that it devolves upon the States the duty of providing
by law both for their capture and delivery.… I say,
then, Sir, that the true intent of the Constitution was to
devolve it upon the States, as a federal duty, to enforce, by
their own laws, within their respective limits, both these
clauses of extradition.”<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Mr. Butler, of South Carolina, at a later day,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under the Constitution, each State of itself ought to
provide for the rendition of all fugitives from labor to their
masters. <i>This was certainly the design of the Constitution.</i>”<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such are some of the authorities, judicial and political,
by which Congressional power over this subject is
denied. And yet, in the face of all authority, and in
defiance of reason, Congress assumed this power. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
done at the demand of Slavery, and for the protection
of Slavery. Of course, such an assumption of undelegated
power was a usurpation at the time, and is a usurpation
still,&mdash;doubly hateful, when it is considered that
it is a usurpation in the name of Slavery. It is hard
to think that Congress was driven to unconstitutional
assumption in such a cause, and that, contrary to sovereign
rules of interpretation, it leaned to Slavery rather
than to Freedom. But the time has come at last when
it may recover the attitude belonging to it under the
Constitution.</p>

<p>In advising the repeal of the Fugitive Slave Act, it is
enough to show that it is founded on usurpation by Congress
of power not granted by the Constitution. But,
even admitting the power, a slight examination will
show that it has been executed in defiance of the Constitution.</p>

<p>The constitutional objections to the Fugitive Slave
Act are abundant. It is not too much to say, that in
every section and at every point it is repugnant to admitted
principles of Constitutional Law.</p>


<h3>UNCONSTITUTIONAL DENIAL OF TRIAL BY JURY.</h3>

<p>Foremost among these objections it is proper to put
the denial of trial by jury to the fugitive whose liberty
is in question. It is well known that Judge Story, who
pronounced the opinion of the Supreme Court affirming
the constitutionality of the early Fugitive Slave Act,
declared that the necessity of a trial by jury had not
been argued before the Court, and that in his opinion
this was still “an open question.”<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> It has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
argued since; but it is difficult to say that it is still
“an open question.” The battles of Freedom are never
lost, and the longer this right is denied the more its
justice has become apparent, until at last it shines resplendent
beyond all contradiction. Even if there were
doubt of the obligation of Congress, there can be no
doubt of the power. Nobody denies that Congress, if
it legislates on this matter, <i>may</i> allow trial by jury.
But here again, if it <i>may</i>, so overwhelming is the claim
of justice, it <span class="smcap">must</span>.</p>

<p>The text of the Constitution leaves the case beyond
question. And here, on the threshold, two necessary
incidents of the delivery are observed: first, it must be
made in the State where the fugitive is found; and,
secondly, it restores to the claimant complete control
over the person, so that the victim may be conveyed
to any part of the country where it is possible to hold a
slave, or he may be sold on the way. The proceedings,
therefore, cannot be regarded, in any just sense, as preliminary
or auxiliary to some future formal trial, as in
the case of a fugitive from justice, but as complete in
themselves, final and conclusive.</p>

<p>It is because of the contempt with which, under
the teachings of Slavery, to the shame of our country,
men have thus far regarded the rights of colored persons,
that courts have been willing for a moment to recognize
the constitutional right to hurl a human being
into bondage without trial by jury. Had the victims
been white, it is easy to see that the rule would have
been different. But it is obvious, that, under the Constitution,
the rule must be the same for all, whether
black or white.</p>

<p>On the one side is a question of property; on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
other side is the vital question of Human Freedom
in its most transcendent form,&mdash;not merely Freedom
for a day or a year, but for life, and the freedom of
generations that shall succeed so long as Slavery endures.
Whether viewed as a question of property or
a question of Human Freedom, the requirement of the
Constitution is equally explicit, and it becomes more
explicit as we examine its history. It is well known,
that, at the close of the National Convention, Elbridge
Gerry refused to sign the Constitution, because, among
other things, it sanctioned the establishment of “a tribunal
<i>without juries</i>,&mdash;a Star-Chamber as to civil cases.”<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
Many united in this opposition, and on the recommendation
of the First Congress an additional safeguard was
added in the following words: “In <i>suits at Common
Law</i>, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty
dollars, <i>the right of trial by jury shall be preserved</i>.”
Words cannot be more positive.</p>

<p>Three conditions, according to this Amendment, are
necessary. <i>First</i>, there must be “a suit.” But the Supreme
Court, in the case of <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>, have
defined a suit to be “the prosecution, or pursuit, of some
<i>claim</i>, demand, or request,”<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>&mdash;thus affirming that the
“claim” for a fugitive is “a suit.” <i>Secondly</i>, there must
be a suit “at Common Law.” But here again the Supreme
Court, in the case of <i>Parsons</i> v. <i>Bedford</i>, while
considering this very clause, has declared that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span> “in a just
sense the Amendment may well be construed to embrace
all suits which are not of Equity and Admiralty jurisdiction,
<i>whatever may be the peculiar form which they
may assume to settle legal rights</i>”;<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and clearly, since the
claim for a fugitive is not a suit in Equity or Admiralty,
but a suit to settle what are culled “legal rights,” it must,
of course, be “a suit at Common Law.” <i>Thirdly</i>, the
value in controversy must “exceed twenty dollars.” But
here again the Supreme Court, in the case of <i>Lee</i> v. <i>Lee</i>,
on a question as to jurisdiction, founded on “the value
in controversy,” has declared that the freedom of the
petitioners, which was the matter in dispute, was “not
susceptible of a pecuniary valuation,”<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>&mdash;showing, that,
since Liberty is above price, the claim to a fugitive always
necessarily presumes that “the value in controversy
exceeds twenty dollars.”</p>

<p>Thus, by a series of separate decisions of the Supreme
Court on the three points involved in the interpretation
of this clause, it is clear beyond question that the claim
to a fugitive is, first, “a suit,”&mdash;secondly, “at Common
Law,”&mdash;thirdly, “where the value in controversy exceeds
twenty dollars”: so that trial by jury is expressly
secured.</p>

<p>Even if the Supreme Court had been silent on this
question, the argument from the old books of the Common
Law would be unanswerable. We are told that
there is nothing new under the sun. Certainly, long
before our Constitution, the claim for a fugitive slave
was known to the Common Law. In early history, and
down even to a late period, the slave in England was
generally called <i>villein</i>, though in the original Latin
judicial forms <i>nativus</i>, implying slavery by birth. Of
course, then as now, he sometimes ventured to <i>escape</i>
from his master; but the Common Law supplied the
appropriate remedy. The claim was prosecuted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span> “a
suit at Common Law,” to which, as to every suit at
Common Law, the trial by jury was necessarily attached.
Blackstone, in his Commentaries, in words which must
have been known to all the lawyers of the Convention,
said of <i>villeins</i>: “They could not leave their lord without
his permission, but, <i>if they ran away</i>, or were purloined
from him, <i>might be claimed and recovered by action,
like beasts or other chattels</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> But this word “action” of
itself implies “a suit at Common Law,” with trial by
jury.</p>

<p>The forms of proceeding in such cases are carefully
preserved in those books which constitute the authoritative
precedents of the Common Law. There are writs,
counts, pleadings, and judgments, all ending in trial by
jury. They will be found in Fitzherbert’s “Natura Brevium.”<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a>
The Year Books and Books of Entries are full
of them. Clearly and indisputably, in England, where
the Common Law has its origin, a claim for a fugitive
slave was “a suit at Common Law,” recognized as such
among its old and settled proceedings, as much as a writ
of replevin for a horse or a writ of right for land. It
follows, then, that the requirement of the Constitution,
read in the illumination of the Common Law, naturally
and necessarily embraces proceedings for the recovery
of fugitive slaves, <i>so far as any such are instituted or
allowed under the Constitution</i>.</p>

<p>And this irresistible conclusion had the support of a
Senator from South Carolina in an earlier period of our
history, before passion had obscured reason and conspiracy
against the Union had blotted out all loyalty to
truth. In reply to a proposition, in 1818, to refer the
claim of the master to a judge without a jury, Mr. Smith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
speaking solely in the interests of property, thus expressed
himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This would give a judge the sole power of deciding <i>the
right of property the master claims in his slave, instead of trying
that right by a jury, as prescribed by the Constitution</i>. He
would be judge of matters of law and matters of fact,&mdash;clothed
with all the powers of a jury, as well as the powers
of a court. Such a principle is unknown in your system of
jurisprudence. <i>Your Constitution has forbid it.</i> It preserves
the right of trial by jury in all cases where the value in controversy
exceeds twenty dollars.”<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, in those days, a partisan of Slavery, while asserting
its divine origin, and vindicating the rendition
of fugitive slaves, recognized the claim of the master as
“a suit at Common Law,” to be tried by a jury; and
this he <i>insisted</i> was prescribed by the Constitution. But
if this Senator could claim trial by jury for the protection
of his pretended property, with much greater reason
might the fugitive claim trial by jury for the protection
of his liberty. Surely, now, when Liberty is regaining
her lost foothold, this protection will not be denied.</p>


<h3>OBJECTIONS TO TRIAL BY JURY.</h3>

<p>To this array of reason and authority there are but
two attempts at reply, so far as the Committee is informed.</p>

<p>(1.) The first asserts that the rendition of the slave
under the Act of Congress is a “preliminary” proceeding,
in the nature of <i>extradition</i>, which does not establish
any right between the parties, but simply hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
the slave over to the local jurisdiction from which he
escaped, and therefore trial by jury is unnecessary. But
this pretension is founded on a plain misapprehension.
It forgets, in the first place, that by ancient authority a
“claim” for a fugitive slave is unquestionably a “suit
at Common Law,” to be determined by a jury <i>before the
judgment of rendition</i>. And it forgets, in the second
place, that the proceedings are in no respect “preliminary”;
that they do not contemplate any other trial
between the parties, but that they fix absolutely the
relations of the parties, making one of them master and
the other slave; that the certificate of rendition is absolute
and unimpeachable by any human tribunal, so that
the claimant, from the moment of its issue, may assert
unqualified ownership over the fugitive; that, under this
certificate, he may proceed at once to demand service
and labor, and enforce his demand by the lash; and
that, instead of returning the victim to that local jurisdiction
from which he is alleged to have escaped, the
claimant may hurry him, chained and manacled, to some
distant plantation, where the only judge will be an overseer,
and the only jury the creatures who aid in enforcing
a terrible power. And the argument forgets, also,
that this cruel judgment may be inflicted upon a freeman,
who, perhaps, has never left his Northern home,
but whose fate will be fixed beyond appeal by the mere
certificate of a commissioner. Surely this simple statement
is enough.</p>

<p>The very word “preliminary” suggests the inquiry,
To what? <i>Preliminary</i> is not an adjective that supports
itself. It requires an adjunct, or an abutment on which
to rest. It is the beginning or introduction to some
further proceeding. It is something incomplete or unfinished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
If it be judicial, it contemplates necessarily
some further judicial proceeding. The judge who pronounces
a preliminary judgment must necessarily have
in mind the judgment to follow, and must recognize his
relation to it. But if there is no judgment to follow,
if there is no contemplation of any further judicial proceeding,
if the actual proceeding is complete and finished,
if it is not the beginning or introduction to any further
proceeding, if there is nothing on which the adjective
“preliminary” can rest, it is absurd to call the proceeding
by this name. Such proceeding is essentially final,
and this is the unquestionable character of that under
the Fugitive Slave Act. To call it “preliminary,” and
on this ground set up apology for denial of trial by
jury, is only another illustration of devices employed
by Slavery to baffle the demands of Freedom.</p>

<p>But it is still said that there may be another trial in
the State whither the slave is conveyed. On this assumption
it has been well remarked, that, if, contrary
to general principles of law attaching to the decision of
a competent tribunal a conclusive force as to the same
right between the same parties, there could be any trial
in the Slave State, then it is <i>another trial</i>, and in no
respect a continuation and completion of the proceedings
before the commissioner. The only trial possible
would be an original suit by the alleged slave against
his <i>actual</i> master, whosoever he might be; for the claimant
may have already sold him to another. But there
can be no legal connection between the two proceedings.
Each is original, and must be decided on its own merits.
In the one case, the <i>actual</i> claimant, whosoever he may
be, is plaintiff, and the slave is defendant; and in the
other case the slave is plaintiff, and the <i>actual</i> master,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
whosoever he may be, is defendant. And the first proceeding
is preliminary to the other only as an illegal
imprisonment is preliminary to a suit for damages. The
whole pretension is lost in its absurdity.</p>

<p>(2.) The second attempt at reply to the argument for
trial by jury may be given in the words of the author
of the Fugitive Slave Act himself. In the debate which
occurred on its passage, Mr. Mason thus expressed himself:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If you pass a law which shall require a trial by jury, not
one man in twenty whose slave escapes will incur the risks
or expense of going after the fugitive. It proposes a trial
according to all the forms of the court. <i>A trial by jury
necessarily carries with it a trial of the whole right</i>, and a
trial of the right to service will be gone into according to all
the forms of the court in determining upon any other fact.…
This involves the detention of the fugitive in the mean
time,&mdash;a detention that is purely informal; and whether
the jury should or should not render a righteous verdict in
the end is a matter I will not inquire into, for it is perfectly
immaterial, <i>as the delay itself would effectually defeat the right
of reclamation</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, in a question of Human Freedom, the delay incident
to trial by jury was unblushingly asserted as a
sufficient reason for denial of the right. On a pretension
so repulsive, it is enough to say that its feebleness is
exceeded only by its audacity.</p>

<p>The Committee, therefore, put aside the attempts at
reply, and confidently rest in the conclusion that the denial
of trial by jury to a person claimed as slave is an
unquestionable violation of the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>


<h3>UNCONSTITUTIONAL DELEGATION OF JUDICIAL POWER
TO COMMISSIONERS WHO ARE NOT JUDGES.</h3>

<p>There is still another objection from unconstitutionality,
which may be treated more briefly; but it is not
less decisive than the two objections already considered.
It is founded on the character of the magistrate to whom
is committed the adjudication of the great question of
Human Freedom, than which none greater is known to
the law.</p>

<p>If it were a question merely of property above
twenty dollars,&mdash;if it were a question of crime, involving
imprisonment under the laws of the United
States,&mdash;especially if it were a question involving
life,&mdash;the trial must be before a judge duly appointed
by the President by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, holding office during good behavior,
receiving for his services a fixed compensation, and
bound by solemn oath of office. But this great question
of Human Freedom is committed to the unaided
judgment of a petty magistrate, called a commissioner,
appointed by the Court instead of the President,
holding his office during the will of the Court instead
of during good behavior, paid by fees according
to each individual case, instead of receiving for his
services a fixed compensation, and not bound by any
oath of office.</p>

<p>A claim for the rendition of a fugitive from service
or labor, constituting as it does “a suit at Common
Law,” and also “a case arising under the Constitution,”
must be determined by a <i>judicial tribunal</i>. But
a commissioner is not a judicial tribunal, nor is he
in any sense a judge; so that he is not entitled, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
the Constitution, to exercise this extraordinary jurisdiction.</p>

<p>As “a suit at Common Law,” the claim must be tried
by the tribunal which has jurisdiction of such suits.
But a commissioner can have no such jurisdiction.</p>

<p>As “a case arising under the Constitution,” it falls
under the judicial power of the United States. But a
commissioner is no part of this power.</p>

<p>Two provisions of the Constitution place this conclusion
beyond question. <i>First</i>, by article three, section
one, it is declared that “<i>the judicial power of the United
States</i> shall be vested in one supreme court, and in
such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to
time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the
supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices
during good behavior, and shall at stated times receive
for their services a compensation which shall not be
diminished during their continuance in office.” <i>Secondly</i>,
by article three, section two, it is declared that
“<i>the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and
equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the
United States</i>, and treaties made, or which shall be made,
under their authority.” Here it appears, first, who are
the judges constituting the judicial power of the United
States, and, secondly, what is the extent of this power.
But a commissioner clearly is not a judge, or any
part of the judicial power. Therefore, by inevitable
conclusion, he cannot have jurisdiction of any “case
arising under the Constitution.” But the Supreme
Court has expressly decided that the proceeding by a
claimant for the delivery of an alleged slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span> “constitutes
in the strictest sense a controversy between the
parties, and <i>a case arising under the Constitution</i> of the
United States, within the express delegation of judicial
power given by that instrument.”<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>And yet a commissioner, dressed in the smallest and
briefest authority, is put forward to determine this great
case under the Constitution, and his judgment is declared
final, and even without appeal. The Fugitive Slave
Act proclaims expressly that he “shall have <i>concurrent
jurisdiction</i> with the judges of the Circuit and District
Courts of the United States”; that he shall “hear and
determine the case of the claimant in a summary manner”;
and that his certificate “shall be conclusive of
the right of the person or persons in whose favor granted
to remove such fugitive to the State or Territory from
which he escaped, <i>and shall prevent all molestation of
such person or persons by any process issued by any court,
judge, magistrate, or other person whomsoever</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Such are
the plenary powers conferred upon the commissioner,
together with an eminent jurisdiction concurrent with
judges of the Circuit and District Courts. This Act, as
originally introduced by Mr. Butler, before the substitute
of Mr. Mason, intrusted this <i>concurrent jurisdiction</i> to
the whole army of postmasters; but a trumpery commissioner,
appointed by a court, is as little entitled to
exercise it as a postmaster. It is not doubted, that, under
existing statutes, a commissioner may be appointed
to take depositions and acknowledgments of bail, and
also to arrest, examine, and detain offenders for trial.
Thus much a court may authorize; <i>but a court cannot
delegate to a commissioner the power of trying a cause</i>,
whether “a suit at Common Law,” or “a case arising
under the Constitution”; <i>nor can Congress authorize a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
court to delegate this power</i>. The whole pretension is a
discredit to the jurisprudence of the country.</p>

<p>Such are three principal objections to the constitutionality
of this Act. One alone is enough. The three
together are more than enough.</p>


<h3>OTHER OBJECTIONS TO THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT.</h3>

<p>But there are other objections, to which the Committee
merely allude.</p>

<p>The offensive Act, defying the whole Law of Evidence,
authorizes a judgment which despoils a man of
his liberty on <i>ex parte</i> testimony, by affidavit, without
the sanction of cross-examination.</p>

<p>It practically denies the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>, ever
known as the palladium of the citizen.</p>

<p>Contrary to the purposes declared by the framers of
the Constitution, it sends the fugitive back “at the public
expense.”<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<p>Adding meanness to violation of the Constitution, it
bribes the commissioner by a double fee to pronounce
against Freedom. If he dooms a man to Slavery, the
reward is ten dollars; but saving him to Freedom, his
dole is five dollars.</p>

<p>As it is for the public weal that there should be an
end of suits, so, by the consent of civilized nations, these
must be instituted within fixed limitations of time; but
the Fugitive Act, exalting Slavery above even this practical
principle of universal justice, ordains proceedings
against Freedom without reference to lapse of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span></p>

<p>Careless of the feelings and conscientious convictions
of good men who cannot help the work of thrusting a
fellow-being back into bondage, this Act declares that
“all good citizens are hereby commanded to aid and assist
in the prompt and efficient execution of this law”;<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
and this injunction is addressed to all alike, not excepting
those who religiously believe that the Divine mandate
is as binding now as when it was first given to the
Hebrews of old: “<span class="smcap">Thou shalt not deliver</span> <i>unto his
master the servant which is escaped from his master unto
thee</i>: he shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that
place which he shall choose, in one of thy gates where
it liketh him best: thou shalt not oppress him.”<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The
thunder of Sinai is silent, and the ancient judgments
have ceased; but an Act of Congress, which, besides its
direct violation of this early law, offends every sentiment
of Christianity, must expect the judgments of
men, even if it escapes those of Heaven. Perhaps the
sorrows and funerals of this war are so many warnings
to do justice.</p>

<p>But this Act is to be seen not merely in its open defiance
of the Constitution, and of all legislative decencies;
it must be considered, also, in two other aspects: first,
in its consequences; and, secondly, in the character of
its authors. The time has come, at last, when each of
these may be exposed.</p>


<h3>CONSEQUENCES OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT.</h3>

<p>And, first, as to its consequences. In the history of
the African race these can never be forgotten. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
the first authorization of the slave-trade, nothing so terrible
had fallen upon this unhappy people, whether we
contemplate its cruelty to individuals or the wide-spread
proscription which it launched against all whose skins
were not white.</p>

<p>It is sad to know of suffering anywhere, even by a
single lowly person. But our feelings are enhanced,
when individual sorrows are multiplied, and the blow
descends upon a whole race. History, too, takes up the
grief. The Jews expelled from Spain by merciless decree,
the Huguenots driven from France by the revocation
of the Edict of Nantes, our own Puritan fathers
compelled to exile for religious Freedom,&mdash;all these receive
a gushing sympathy, and we detest the tyrants.
These were persecutions for religion, in days of religious
bigotry and darkness. But an American Congress, in
this age of Christian light, not in the fanaticism of religion,
but in the fanaticism of Slavery, did a deed that
finds companionship only with these enormities of the
past. The Fugitive Slave Act carried distress and
terror to every person with African blood in the Free
States. All were fluttered, as the arbitrary edict commenced
its swoop over the land. The very rumor that
a slave-hunter was in town so shook the nerves of a
sensitive freeman on whom was the ban of color, that
he died. To large numbers the Act was a decree of
instant expulsion from the Republic, under penalty of
Slavery to them and their posterity forever. Driven by
despair, as many as six thousand Christian men and
women, meritorious persons,&mdash;a larger band than that of
the escaping Puritans,&mdash;precipitately fled from homes
they had established, opportunities of usefulness they
had found, and the regard of fellow-citizens, until, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
last, in an unwelcome Northern climate, beneath the
British flag, with glad voices of Freedom on their lips,
though with the yearnings of exile in their hearts,
they were happy in swelling the chant, “God save the
Queen!”</p>

<p>Such an injustice cannot be restricted in influence.
Everywhere it is an extension of Slavery, with all the
wrong, violence, and brutality which are the natural
outgrowth of Slavery. The Free States became little
better than a huge outlying plantation quivering under
the lash of the overseer; or rather, they were a diversified
hunting-ground for the flying bondmen, resounding
always with the “halloo” of the huntsman. There
seemed no rest. The chase was hardly over at Boston
before it was started at Philadelphia, Syracuse, or
Buffalo, and then again raged furiously across the prairies
of the West. Not an instance occurred which did
not shock the conscience of the country and sting it with
anger. Records of the time attest the accuracy of this
statement. Perhaps there is no example in history
where human passion showed itself in grander forms,
or eloquence lent all her gifts more completely to the
demands of Liberty, than the speech of an eminent
character, now dead and buried in a foreign land,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> denouncing
the capture of Thomas Sims at Boston, and
invoking the judgment of God and man upon the agents
in this wickedness. In the history of Humanity this
great effort cannot be forgotten. But every case pleaded
with an eloquence of its own, until, at last, occurred one
of those tragedies darkening the heavens and crying out
with a voice that will be heard. It was the voice of a
mother standing over her murdered child. Margaret Garner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
escaped from Slavery with three children, but was
overtaken at Cincinnati. Unwilling to behold her offspring
returned to the shambles of the South, this unhappy
person, described in the testimony as “a womanly,
amiable, affectionate mother,” determined to save them
in the only way within her power. With a butcher-knife,
coolly and deliberately, she took the life of one
of the children, “almost white, and a little girl of rare
beauty,” and attempted, without success, to take the life
of the other two. To the preacher who interrogated her
she exclaimed: “The child was my own, given me of
God to do the best a mother could in its behalf. I
have done the best I could; I would have done more
and better for the rest; I knew it was better for them
to go home to God than back to Slavery.” But she was
restrained in her purpose. The Fugitive Slave Act triumphed,
and, after the determination of sundry questions
of jurisdiction, this devoted historic mother, with
the two children remaining to her, and the dead body
of the little one just emancipated, under a national
escort of armed men, was hurried to the doom of Slavery.
Her case did not end with this revolting sacrifice.
So long as the human heart is moved by human
suffering, the story of this mother will be read with
alternate anger and grief, while it is studied as a perpetual
witness to the slaveholding tyranny which then
ruled the Republic with execrable exactions, destined
at last to break out in war,&mdash;as the sacrifice of Virginia
by her father is a perpetual witness to the decemviral
tyranny which ruled Rome.</p>

<p>But Liberty is always priceless. There are other instances,
less known, where kindred wrong has been done.
Every case is a tragedy, under the forms of law. Worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
than poisoned bowl or dagger was the certificate of
a commissioner, allowed, without interruption, to continue
his dreadful trade. Even since the Rebellion
has raged in blood, the pretension of returning slaves
to their masters is not abandoned. The piety of Abraham,
who offered up Isaac as a sacrifice to Jehovah,
is imitated, and the country continues to offer up fugitive
bondmen as a sacrifice to Slavery. It is reported
on good authority, that among slaves thus sacrificed
was one who by communications to the Government
had been the means of saving upwards of one hundred
thousand dollars. Here in Washington, since the beneficent
Act of Emancipation, even in sight of the flag
floating from the National Capitol, the Fugitive Slave
Act has been made a scourge and a terror to innocent
men and women.</p>

<p>If all these pains and sorrows had redounded in any
respect to the honor of the country, or had contributed
in any way to the strength of the Union, then we might
confess, perhaps, that something at least had been gained.
But, alas! there has been nothing but unmixed evil.
The country has suffered in good name, while foreign
nations have pointed with scorn to a republic which
could legalize such indecencies. Not a case occurred
which was not greedily chronicled in Europe, and circulated
there by the enemies of liberal institutions. Even
since the Rebellion began in the name of Slavery, the
existence of this odious enactment unrepealed on our
statute-book has been quoted abroad to show that the
supporters of the Union are as little deserving of sympathy
as Rebel Slavemongers. By the enforcement of
this odious Act the Union has suffered from the beginning;
for not a slave is thrust back into bondage without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
weakening those patriotic sympathies, North and
South, which are its best support. The natural irritation
of the North, as it beheld all safeguards of Freedom
overthrown and Slavery triumphant in its very streets,
was answered by savage exultation in the South,
which seemed to dance about its victims. Each instance
was the occasion of new exasperations on both
sides, which were skilfully employed by wicked conspirators
“to fire the Southern heart.”</p>


<h3>AUTHORS OF THE FUGITIVE SLAVE ACT.</h3>

<p>Such are some of the consequences of this ill-fated
measure. But the duty of the Committee cannot be
performed without glancing at its authors also. By an
easy transition we pass from one to the other, for the
two are in natural harmony. Each may be read in the
light of the other.</p>

<p>And who were the authors of this Fugitive Slave Act?
The answer may be general or special.</p>

<p>If general, it may be said that its authors were the
representatives of Slavery, constituting that same Oligarchy,
or Slave Power, which has madly plunged this
country into civil war. Some of them, even at the time
of its enactment, were already engaged in treasonable
conspiracy against the Union. They thought little of
any pretended interests in property; but they were occupied
with two controlling ideas: first, how to unite
their own people at home; and, secondly, how to insult
and subjugate the Free States. The Fugitive Slave Act
furnished a convenient agency for this double purpose,
and was naturally adopted by men who had lost the
power of blushing as well as the power of feeling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>Unquestionable facts show how little real occasion
there was for this barbarous statute. It is now established
by the report of the census in 1860, that the
loss of slaves by escape was trivial. According to this
document, “the whole annual loss to the Southern States
from this cause bears less proportion to the amount of
capital involved than the daily variations which, in ordinary
times, occur in the fluctuations of State or Government
securities in the city of New York alone.”<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
Such a statement is most suggestive. Official tables furnish
confirmatory details. From these it appears that
during the year ending June 1, 1860, out of 3,949,557
slaves, only 803 were able to escape, being one to about
five thousand, or at the rate of one fiftieth of one per
cent. Then again, out of more than one million of slaves
in the Border States in 1860, fewer than five hundred
escaped. Such are authentic facts. Nor is this all. The
slave who succeeded in escaping, even when reënslaved,
was never afterwards regarded as good property. All
the work he could do would not compensate for his bad
example. Jefferson Davis, in the frankness of an address
to his constituents at home in Mississippi, on the 11th
July, 1851, said openly that he did not want any fugitive
slaves sent into his State; that “such stock would be a
curse to the land,&mdash;for, with the knowledge they had
gained, they would ruin the rest of the slaves, and very
probably give rise to the most dreadful consequences”;
and he concluded by announcing, that “he would not
have in his quarters a negro brought from the North on
any account whatever.”<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> And yet, in face of such authentic
facts, showing how few escaped, and in face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
of an instinctive repugnance to any commingling with
other slaves by those who had once tasted Liberty, this
atrocious statute was enacted, and its enforcement was
maintained at the point of the bayonet, while Jefferson
Davis was Secretary of War.</p>

<p>There have been wars of <i>pretext</i>; but here was an
act of legislation, which, whenever enforced, was a <i>Petty
War</i>, and its origin was a pretext. It was nothing but
a pretext, through which the representatives of Slavery
sought to enforce a flagitious power. The pretext was
worthy of the legislation, and both pretext and legislation
were in harmony with the authors, who drew
their motives of conduct from Slavery and nothing else.
The same spirit which triumphed in this Fugitive Slave
Act, on a pretext, has at last broken forth in rebellion,
on a pretext also. Each was under pretext of maintaining
Slavery, and each proceeded from the same influence.</p>

<p>Speaking, then, in general terms, the authors of the
Fugitive Slave Act were the authors of the Rebellion.
The one and the other have the same paternity, as unquestionably
they have a family likeness.</p>

<p>If, however, we go still further, and seek the individual
authors of this odious measure, the forerunner of the
Rebellion, it is easy to point them out.</p>

<p>The bill was reported to the Senate by Mr. Butler, of
South Carolina, so that in origin it may be traced directly
to the hot-house of nullification, treason, and
rebellion. But Mr. Mason, of Virginia, subsequently
moved a substitute, which, being adopted, became the
existing statute, and this enormity stalked into life under
the patronage of a Senator from Virginia. Public
report, which is entitled to belief, attributes this substitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
to the cunning hand of Mr. Faulkner, also of Virginia;
but, on moving it in the Senate, Mr. Mason made
it his own, and pressed it with untiring pertinacity, as
the “Globe” amply attests, until it became the law of
the land, so far as such a measure can in any just sense
be “law.”</p>

<p>But whether its authors be found in States or individuals,
there is in it the same pernicious virus, which,
breaking out first in South Carolina, inoculated Virginia,
like the Rebellion itself. A Senator from Virginia
took from South Carolina the final responsibility, as an
aged madman from Virginia asked and obtained permission
to point the first gun at Fort Sumter. Nor are the
two events unlike in character. The Fugitive Slave
Act was levelled at the Union hardly less than the
batteries at Charleston, when they opened upon Fort
Sumter.</p>

<p>Such are the authors, general and special, of this
wickedness. The Senator from South Carolina is dead;
but the representatives of Slavery still live, and so also
do the two madmen from Virginia. Thus the representatives
of Slavery, though now in open rebellion,
continue, through unrepealed statute, to insult the loyal
States, to degrade the Republic, and to rule the country
which they tried to ruin. And thus two audacious
Rebels, one the pretended Minister of the Rebellion at
London, and the other an officer in the Rebel forces,
still exert among us a malignant power, while, with
a long arm not yet amputated, they reach even into
the streets of Washington, and fasten the chains of the
slave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>


<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>To all this there is one simple answer, and Congress
must make it.</p>

<p>A clause of the Constitution, contrary to all commanding
rules of jurisprudence, has been interpreted
to sanction the hunting of slaves; and the same clause,
thus interpreted, has been declared, contrary to all testimony
of history, to have been an original compromise
of the Constitution and a corner-stone of the Union. On
this clause, thus misinterpreted and thus misrepresented,
an Act of Congress is founded, which, even assuming
that the clause is strictly applicable to fugitive slaves,
is many times unconstitutional, but especially in three
several particulars: (1.) as a usurpation by Congress of
powers not granted by the Constitution; (2.) as a denial
of trial by jury in a case of personal liberty and a suit
at Common Law; and (3.) as a concession of the case
of personal liberty to the unaided judgment of a single
petty magistrate, without any oath of office, constituting
no part of the judicial power,&mdash;appointed, not by the
President with the consent of the Senate, but by the
court,&mdash;holding office, not during good behavior, but
merely during the will of the court,&mdash;and receiving, not
a regular salary, but fees according to each individual
case. But even if this Act were strictly constitutional
in all respects, yet, regarding it in its painful consequences
and in its Rebel authors, it is none the less
offensive; for from the beginning it was a scourge to
the African race and a grievance to the whole country,
a scandal abroad and a dead-weight upon the Union
at home, while it was the arch contrivance of men who
at the time were rebel at heart and are now in open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
rebellion, devised as an insult to the Free States and
as a badge of subjugation. Such a statute, thus utterly
unconstitutional in every respect, and utterly mischievous
in all its consequences and influences, while peculiarly
obnoxious in its well-known authors, ought to
be repealed without delay. If possible to parliamentary
usage, it ought to be torn from the volumes of the
law, so that there should be no record of such an abuse
and such a shame.</p>

<p>Unhappily, the statute must always remain in the
pages of our history. But every day of delay in its
repeal is hurtful to the national cause and to the national
name. Would you put down the Rebellion?
Would you uphold our fame abroad? Would you save
the Constitution from outrage? Would you extinguish
Slavery? Above all, would you follow the Constitution
and establish justice? Then repeal the statute
at once.</p>

“An Act to regulate the conduct of her Majesty’s subjects during the
existence of hostilities between foreign states with which her Majesty is at
peace,” makes it illegal, if any person within her Majesty’s dominions “builds,

military or naval service of any foreign state at war with any friendly state.”

France at Washington, justifies this statement. “If the civil war,” says he,
“had not broken out, or if the French Government had foreseen the final
victory of the North and the reconstruction of the American power, never
would the idea of founding a throne in Mexico by European arms have entered
into its head.… The fall of the American Republic was, from the
beginning of this great trouble, among the aspirations of the French Government,
and its most accredited organs made no mystery of it.” Attributing
to England the same desire and the same judgment on the probable issue
of the war, the distinguished writer says the English Government simply
waited events, “in a malevolent neutrality towards the North.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kératry</span>,

that the French Emperor embraced Texas in his Mexican plot. (Lawrence,
Commentaire sur les Éléments du Droit International, Tom. II. p. 360, Part.
II. ch. 1.) In European diplomatic circles it was reported that he had tried
to seduce a prince of Portugal by tender of the throne of Mexico with the
promise of Texas.</p>

enter the City of Mexico till 12th June, 1864. The new Empire was
acknowledged by all the European powers. The United States refused
to acknowledge it. The suppression of our Rebellion was followed by the
withdrawal of the French troops, and the execution of Maximilian, who
was condemned to death and shot by the Mexicans, 19th June, 1867.</p>

July, 1871, the London “Daily Telegraph” of August 2d recognized
the parallel with Franklin. After remarking that “during the whole of 1862,
and the first six months of 1863, it was the general belief of the most far-seeing
statesmen in Europe&mdash;among them Lord Palmerston and the ex-Emperor
of the French&mdash;that the Confederate States would succeed in establishing
their independence,” this journal proceeds to say: “Mr. Mason and
Mr. Slidell were therefore invested, during these brief and halcyon days of
Secession’s prosperity, with something of the diplomatic influence which
between 1776 and 1783 attached to Benjamin Franklin, when accredited by
our insurgent North American Colonies to the French Court.”</p>
